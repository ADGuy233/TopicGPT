      "['[deleted] []       And as far as fully-automatic weapons, you can be a lot better []armed if you want to hit what you aim at. []  Define \"armed better\". Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the Colt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which faster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other guys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson in hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it\\'s M-16 now to 3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).  A revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.  - A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull   the trigger again. - A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,   but will fire merely by pulling the trigger. - A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again   to rotate to the next round. - A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the   hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an   easy motion, even one handed. - Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines   on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.  - A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell   first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often   lost as you realize \"hey, it\\'s jammed!\" before starting to do anything   about clearing it. - Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round   and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the    chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider   this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed   of employment as a revolver. - There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of   operation of many of them requires more training.  Some police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly switching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having accidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocks require rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complex as the timer on a VCR.  Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun the police don\\'t know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunter and pay attention. I do not seek here to say \"semi-autos are junk\" merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A cop with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than equipped for anything short of a riot.  Gun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a  wonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don\\'t hit anything. Good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit. I own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon to something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I haven\\'t hit what I\\'m aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriously wrong somewheres. While I might like having the backup capacity of those extra shots in certain cases, overwhelmingly the # of shots fired in criminal encounters is less than 5.  What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple .38 revolvers that the police often use. Well actually some police  prefer the much heftier .357 Magnum, but anyway.....  ObPlea: Don\\'t flame me, I prefer semi-autos for most things. But they          introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve-wracking         as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal. ', ' Every city and suburban police officer I\\'ve seen around the Twin Cities in the last two years has carried a semi-auto of some type (different brands though I haven\\'t seen any Glock\\'s).   With regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usual rantings of t.p.g, and close to the realm of r.g, but I\\'d like to put my two cents worth in.  While there\\'s nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a  large frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to semi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob\\'s (I know, some people can\\'t stand him and think he\\'s full of bull, but I think that in general his material is very valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something  like that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto\\'s are different, and that \"different is good\".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in  more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a certain \"propriatory nature\" of each gun that takes some familiarity to  learn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar with different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.   Yes, but this is best done with a two hand hold.  With a single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi auto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.    I\\'m not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA semi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same round - an advantage you don\\'t have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will always go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it\\'s very rare, but your round will now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide on a misfire takes very little time.    Actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not necessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the round to set it off.   The best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed loaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the gun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always  take more time.  You also don\\'t have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can still be used if needed later).     Yes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear it.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire with factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).     All common semi-auto\\'s can be carried with a round in their chamber without any safety problems.  While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should say that this applies to all of the ones I\\'ve looked at.  For the DA semi\\'s it\\'s no different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing pin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there\\'s no real advantage carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed of employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I\\'m not familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining the design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and  shooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.   Yeah, the infamous Glock.  I still can\\'t figure out how it\\'s worse than a revolver for safety.  If you don\\'t pull the trigger it doesn\\'t go off.  I imagine that if all your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger far enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed that nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew off your foot then you\\'d have problems when the hammer wasn\\'t there.   I think this is even okay for a riot (as long as it\\'s a small one B^)).   I have the poor man\\'s Beretta (Taurus 99) and consider it inferior as a carry weapon to the Springfield .45 (oops, 9mm vs. 45 arguments are relegated to r.g).  You are right, though.  If you don\\'t hit what you aim at then the shooter/gun combination has failed.  I don\\'t ascribe failures in the the fire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun.  This is a shooter failure, whether through lack of discipline or lack of training.    9mm\\'s are becoming more popular with crooks too, though the .38 does still lead the list.  And like I said, around here semi-auto\\'s seem the rule for the street cop.  Don\\'t know about the State Patrol however, they may still carry the \"Highway Patrolman\".   Vincent, please don\\'t take any of this as a flame.  Just my $0.02 (whoops, looks more like $2.00) worth.  And much of it is IMHO, but do check Ayoob\\'s book.', '/ iftccu:talk.politics.guns / vincent@cad.gatech.edu (Vincent Fox) / 10:34 am  Apr 14, 1993 /  This isn\\'t rec.guns, so maybe this is getting a bet technical, but I can\\'t resist....   Sometimes.....  Depends on WHY it misfired....   I can\\'t imagine doing much combat type shooting single action.....   Assuming the cylinder WILL rotate....   Never hurts to err on the side of safety, but if you\\'ve got one of those \\'new fangled\\' hammer blocks or transfer bar safeties, it\\'s unnecessarily redundant.  I\\'d rather have the extra round.   Quite true.  Speed loaders are a little less convenient to pack around than magazines though.   True, but this is a training function.   Cocked and locked for single actions or hammer down on double actions are the only carry modes that make sense...  The 80 series Colt\\'s for example are quite safe to carry this way.   Agreed.  Now that I\\'ve shot off my mouth a bit, let me back some of this up.  It is true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn\\'t cost you much.  On the other hand, I\\'ve had all sorts of interesting things happen over the years.  For example, I\\'ve had FACTORY ammunition that has had high primers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds to minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem. An auto?  Jack the slide and continue.  I\\'ve had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder from turning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happen with a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.  Most revolvers are more \\'fragile\\' then semi auto\\'s.  There are all sorts of close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or a blow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Many of the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto take a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likely to malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you\\'re out of the fight. The majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall into that category.  Vincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposing view of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob\\'s \"The Semi Auto Pistol for Police and Self Defense.\"  In general, I\\'d agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self defense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination that is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi auto effectively as a self defense arm.  Most cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the department isn\\'t going to train them, they aren\\'t going to take the time on their own.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount of training required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several times that of a revolver.  Many cops don\\'t bother.  For myself, I\\'d hate to be limited to one or the other.  I\\'d rather pick what fits better with my personal inclination, what I\\'m wearing that day and so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!  That said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of buying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a Ruger or Smith revolver....  (Sorry Colt fans.  Colt revolvers are ok too!)  If this post had gone the other way, I\\'d be arguing for revolvers. :-)', '   Well, let me see.  UZI, no.  M-11/9, no.  M-16/AR-15, maybe.  I remember there being a selector swtich on the AR-15.  If I remember correctly (please correct me if I\\'m wrong) the switch would set to an \"off\" position or an \"on\" position because the gun (AR-15) is semi-automatic.  Wouldn\\'t the M-16 have a position for semi-auto fire and full-auto fire (or maybe 3 round bursts)?  If this is correct wouldn\\'t it be easy to distinguish each gun by this alone?  Of course if the AR-15 were modified to full-auto fire I wouldn\\'t think it would be that easy but I\\'m talking about distinguishing between an unmodified AR-15 and M-16. How about the other guns?  Do they also have selector switch to switch between semi-auto and fully-auto fire?     Actually it was pretty hard for the kids in my neighborhood to figure that out as Richard Petty lived in my neighborhood and left his stock car in the  driveway. ;-)    Well, what about what I said above?  If that is correct I guess TV would be acceptable (if you had a good enough picture and a picture of the lower  receiver of the AR-15/M-16).']\n"

Document 854: This document is a quote from a post discussing the manufacturing of submachine guns and refers to the book \\\"Smallarms of the World\\\" for more information.\\n\\n2. Document 506: This document provides information about an anonymous FTP RKBA (Right to Keep and Bear Arms) archive with various files related to firearms, including reports, bills, and resolutions related to gun control.\\n\\n3. Document 1113: This document discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using semi-automatic handguns compared to revolvers, including factors such as rate of fire, ease of use, safety, and reload speed.\\n\\n4. Document 1119: This document addresses the distinction between semi-automatic rifles like the AR-15 and fully automatic rifles like the M-16. It mentions the selector switch on the AR-15 for semi-automatic fire, while the M-16 also has a full-auto or burst-fire mode.\\n\\n5. Document 838: This document discusses the issue of gun control and different methods proposed to keep guns away from \\\"bad people\\\" while still allowing access for \\\"good people\\\". It mentions Japan's near-total isolation from the world and the regulation of hunting weapons requiring reloading after a few shots.\\n\\nThese documents provide a range of information about semi-automatic rifles, including manufacturing, legislative matters, comparisons with other firearms, and gun control discussions.\"\n",

Just about ANYBODY with basic manufacturing skill can turn out HIGH QUALITY submachineguns.  A  couple of high school shop teachers were recently arrested for building  submachineguns in the school shop.  I suggest that you go to the library and find a copy of \"Smallarms of the  World\".  Your entire premise is based on non-factual assumptions. '"
