       "[\"This was their first true recording project, although it was thier second full album. I give this album four stars, because, though I love this album and this band, Five stars would mean it's an album that stands next to Physical Graffitti, the White Album, and a select few other records. This album is a must own for fans who enjoy any of the splinter disciplines of what Sabbath, Hendrix, and Zeppelin started. An album worth the money, with many great songs and performances. If there are any criticisms, one would be the production. It leaves some room for improvement. Beyond that, I hope this band can continue to build upon this awesome release for years to come. Purchas and enjoy!\",\n",

Those who are accustomed to Down South music will probably not like some of the west coast funk. It's a different flavor for some. Me being from Cali, I love this stuff. It is rare that someone captures the essence of the west. I do agree with this not being the best album but it's still worth buying. It's got enough head-bangers to get you to the club. That's Cali-4-ya.... 3 1/2 stars\",\n",

Utilizing a stunning mixture of layered guitar melodies, gloomy synths, and thunderous percussion, Varg works his way through three hypnotic metal songs before the ambitious ambient outro - Tomhet. Rather than sit here and rattle on about the magic contained within this record, I would rather just claim that it is a must have for any black metal fan, and ranks among the highest calibur or metal releases period.',\n",

If you heard the first track, Laetitia kinda does the loud humming and someone keeps on playing the synthesizer. It reminds me of the Beatles\\' eerie song \"Revolution 9\" from the \"White Album.\" I could\\'ve just imagined while listening to \"Baby Lulu\" and it makes your mind clear with soothing and beautiful sounds. This is the best album I\\'ve ever heard, and I listen to this album while I study and you should listen to this while you\\'re at work or home. Stereolab totally gets your stresses away by listening to them. Bye-Bye! :-)',\n",

I think some people don\\'t understand that things sound the way they were MEANT to sound, if they sound poppy, they made it that way, why the hell should they stick to the norm? They want to do something different and in my opinion it sounds great.I can\\'t write a good enough review for this album, all their albums actually, as they are all a masterpiece of their own while still being different enough to keep it interesting. It bugs me when a group doesn\\'t evolve or try new things and stays exactly the same as they ever were, all the time, so I was glad to see them progress and \"grow\".There\\'s too much to say to describe this album, but frankly I don\\'t think I could write a good enough review to do it justice, so I\\'ll just give it my 5 stars :)',\n",

I could quibble with some things in the lyrics which are not quite in line with the lore, but overall I find the music both pleasant and inspiring.This CD draws upon Scandinavian folk music for inspiration for its melodies. With the exception of one track, the lyrics are in English. The lead singer, Andrea Nebel Haugan, can actually sing! Professionally done and melodic.Many of my non-Heathen friends also enjoy listening to this CD.',\n",

When it first came out, it might have been groundbreaking, but so much has happened since in the world of technical/avant-garde metal, that much of this album now sounds a little tame. The material hasn\\'t aged very well. There are a couple of truly great songs in the middle-- all of the others are definitely good, just not mind-blowing (as some of the material on their older albums still is). The new vocalist on this album added a new dimension to the band-- a great improvement over Snake, in my opinion. If you want a truly great album, though, get their next, \"Phobos.\"',\n",

Before I turned it on, I knew I would like my favorites, Sweet Jane and Walk on the Wild Side, but I found myself enveloped in the other songs, which I had never heard before. I was a casual Lou Reed Fan.I think if I liked it, then a real hardcore fan will love it.The video is high quality and the sound is great, it's like having a front row seat. I'm glad I purchased this one.\",\n",

       " \"The moment I put this cd on and heard the light, lulling strum of a dreamy guitar fluttering like soft breezes that carried with them the whispered caresses of sun-kissed Gregorian chants, followed by the ocean spray of some middle eastern voice sweetly singing amidst gorgeous strings and a hypnotic beat, I knew this was going to be one journey I'd be willing to take for many years to come...and that was the impression I got from the first track alone! Imagine what ensued... It only gets better from there!Every song is aptly titled to create a spellbinding mood, and while I find this exotically soothing debut album by Black Ether (an astonishingly overlooked group) extremely hard to classify because it is so diversified in its use of instruments and styles, I'd have to say if you enjoy lush chillout music with an ethnic-world flavor to it than this is most definitely your cup of tea.\",\n",
       " \"Not everyone can like every album. But, for me, One Second is my all-time favorite. I have listed to it regularly since it was first released and have never tired of the complex rhythms and musical variety that it offers. One Second is different from Yello's other albums and, in my opinion, doesn't hold as much appeal for someone looking for pure techno. While the drum machines and sequencers are certainly there (and brilliantly done), the sound is less annalog and has more feel. It is not background music, but rather must be listened to to be enjoyed. The latin influence is wonderful and the music sounds as if it were made for Shirley Bassey's style and voice. In my mind, this album creates its own genre of music which I have yet to find elsewhere. It is different, but it is very very good!\",\n",
       " 'Like this is breath of fresh air in the dance music world filled with meaningless Technobeat with no specific direction. This song brought back the good memories of the 70\\'s by using a sample of the classic \"clean up the ghetto\". Monday Midnite\\'s freestyle story about his experience at a London underground discotheque is unique and his succintly clear and distinctive accent is rare and I like it a lot. Plus, the song keeps you dancing till the last beat. Love it.',\n",
       " 'First thing\\'s first, \"Homespun\" is an album of demos for \"Apple Venus\". If you don\\'t have that record, look there first (although if you\\'re new to XTC, \"Skylarking\" is the usual recommendation).So a collection of demos, what to expect? Essentially it\\'s a track-by-track match for \"Apple Venus\". Sonically, you couldn\\'t tell it\\'s so much a set of demos except in a couple places (\"Frivolous Tonight\") because it sounds so complete, in fact to the point where some pieces sound virtually identical to their final takes-- even in places you wouldn\\'t expect it like orchestral workouts \"River of Orchids\" and \"Green Man\".Is it interesting? Yeah, extremely, and in a lot of places it can be as good or better than the original (\"Knights in Shining Karma\"), but truth to be told, unless you\\'re a diehard, you probably don\\'t need to hear the work versions of this material. More casual fans definitely want to check out \"Apple Venus\", it\\'s a fine record.',\n",

A true Magnum fan, In the past I followed them all the way to see them perform live and at there very best, which was in my own personal opinion...All the time ! Vigilante is certainly one of Magnum`s finest example`s of good solid heavy rock on any one given Cd ! \"Need a lot of Love\" is one of there finest along with \"Vigilante\" of coarse ! And there is also track`s like \"Lonely Night\" and \"Midnight\" on there too ! I personally have all Magnum`s Cd`s as I`m so into there genre of music and culture ! I Simply could`nt be without !

Hatebreed goes further than just delivering a simple hardcore sound - they truly give it in a way that makes me FEEL the music. It has the ability to take one to the emotional edge and back.

There is an incredible mix of fun, epic, and emotional songs. Those sad and beautiful tracks I especially like, as there's not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks. I must admit that one of the songs (Life-A Distant Promise) has brought tears to my eyes on many occasions.My one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs, which I find distracting.

This band has as much to do with hardcore as Sepultura.

My favorite song is definitely \"Will He Be Waiting For Me.\" This is bluegrass, but I definitely like a female singing it. It just mellows it out. Dolly has now put out two great albums and with rumors of her possibly going on tour, I couldn\\'t be happier. I\\'m 26, have been listening to her since I was little, and have never gotten to see her perform live. But this album, the critics aren\\'t just praising a country hall of famer -- the album deserves every wonderful word.',\n",

       " 'This CD has instrumental experimental Jazz and near trance synthesizer pieces. Some of the rhythm patterns have a Latin flavor and feel very danceable. Others remind me of chill out lounge music. A few selections have some subdued vocals that are more part of the background rather than the foreground. I enjoyed the selections and liked working with them in the background. I have not heard the other volumes in the series and so I cannot compare them with each other. My only reservations about this collection is that the mood between selections is not always consistent, some are more mellow and some are more lively. But the mood of the CD is more consistent than a lot of collections I have heard. Some of the pieces are more experimental than the others and are interesting studies. Two of them felt slightly dissident to me, but the experimental sound still felt worth hearing.',\n",

Every track in amazing from beginning to end. I was unfamiliar with Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heild's work. This cd however makes me want to definatly look into it. It is the perfect sound to go along with the dark nature of the film. Some tracks are very tranquil and moody, while others pound out beats and are very fast paced.

The one downside about this wonderful collection is that the 3rd CD contains mostly less well-known tunes, with the exceeption of two Diana Ross/Supremes cuts: \"My World is Empty Without You\" and \"Forever Came Today\".
