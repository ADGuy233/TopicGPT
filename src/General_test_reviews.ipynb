       "'Jane Eyre, a woman with courage, with passion, with determination, demonstrates a remarkable amount of pride while she lives her life. Her mixed life mingles between feeling sorry for her orphaned self and trying to be a romantic wife to Mr. Rochester. The novel, Jane Eyre, is an excellent work of Charlotte Bront not only because of the work itself, but because it is a relation to herself as an autobiography. Charlotte Bront was not that much different than the main character, Jane Eyre, in that they both lived without parents and they both know what loss can be like. The book flows eloquently from start to finish and contains many life morals concerning pride, love, and what it takes to live in this world. Jane Eyre shows how one can mature in to the person that they will be for the rest of their life. Because of this book, my life has been enlightened with good morals and I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone.'"
