Kenneth May, President of Holly Farms Poultry Industries   and a director of the National Broiler Council, told a House   Agriculture subcommittee the incidence of salmonella in chicken   has not increased in recent years and that chicken is neither   the major source of the bacterial poisoning nor the cause of an   increase in outbreaks of the disease.       May said the Center for Disease Control figures showed that   between 1978 and 1982, chicken was involved in four pct of all   U.S. salmonellosis outbreaks, while beef accounted for ten pct   of outbreaks and dairy products six pct.       May said the remaining outbreaks were caused by salads and   mixed food, turkey, seafood, pork, eggs and other foods.       May said the chicken industry favored moving away from   bird-by-bird inspection procedures to a risk assessment system   better able to identify microbial and bacterial contamination   of poultry.       However, Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice for   Food and Health Policy, said bird-by-bird inspection should be   retained and labels should be attached to each ready-to-cook   chicken to remind consumers about preparation procedures   necessary to avoid illness.       Haas also called for a review of present chicken industry   inspection methods that she said can worsen poultry hazards.     \", \"CCC ACCEPTS BONUS ON POULTRY TO EGYPT -- USDA   The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC)   has accepted a bid for two bonus offers to cover the sale of   10,000 tonnes of frozen poultry to Egypt, the U.S. Agriculture   Department said.       The poultry is for shipment November, 1987, through August,   1988, and the bonus was 473.99 dlrs per tonne for the frozen   fryer legs. The bonuses were made to Gress Foods, Inc (5,000   tonnes), and Serva International Ltd (5,000 tonnes).       The subsidies will be paid to the exporters in the form of   commodities from CCC stocks.       An additional 8,500 tonnes of frozen poultry remain   available to Egypt under the Export Enhancement Program   initiative announced Dec 19, 1986, and Feb 27, 1987, the   department said.     \", \"EX-USDA OFFICIAL URGES CHICKEN HANDLING LABELS   A former U.S. Agriculture Department   official urged the department to require that packages of   chicken be labeled with handling and cooking instructions to   protect the public from disease.       Carol Tucker Foreman, President of Foreman and Heidepriem   and a former assistant secretary of agriculture for food and   consumer services, told a House Agriculture subcommittee, \\\\\"every   hour of every day, 22 Americans become victims of chicken   contaminated with salmonella.\\\\\"       She said every two and a half weeks, an American dies of   salmonellosis or complications arising from it and the   incidence of poisoning from poultry has increased steadily over   the past several years.       Foreman said USDA should follow a National Academy of   Sciences recommendation to label chicken packages to remind   consumers of preparation procedures necessary to avoid illness.       She urged USDA to require that birds be washed thoroughly   before they are defeathered and that defeathering machines be   cleaned several times a day, that birds be condemned if their   intestines are punctured or there is visible fecal   contamination and that chiller water be changed more often.       Kenneth Blaylock, President of the American Federation of   Government Employees, said a poultry industry recommendation to   move away from the current bird-by-bird inspection could prove   \\\\\"disastrous.\\\\\" He said a strengthened bird-by-bird inspection with   slower line speeds was the foundation upon which new inspection   techniques should be overlaid.     \", \"CCC ACCEPTS BONUS ON POULTRY TO IRAQ -- USDA   The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC)   has accepted a bid for an export bonus to cover the sale of   15,000 tonnes of frozen poultry to Iraq, the U.S. Agriculture   Department said.       The poultry is for shipment June-September and the bonus   was 719.80 dlrs per tone, it said.       The bonus award was made to ConAgra Poultry Co and will be   paid in the form of commodities from the inventory of CCC   stocks.       The purchase completes the Export Enhancement initiative   for Frozen Poultry to Iraq announced December 22, 1986.     \", \"U.S. MEAT, POULTRY INSPECTION CALLED FAULTY   The U.S. meat and poultry inspection   programs are incapable of protecting consumers from   contaminated products, groups representing inspectors and   consumers charged.       \\\\\"The whole trend of inspection for the last 10 years has   been to corrupt and to degrade the system where today the   public is at constant risk to contaminated and adulterated   meat,\\\\\" Kenneth Blaylock, president of the American Federation of   Government Employees, told a House Agriculture subcommittee.       \\\\\"The American consumer has little reason to feel confident   about the safety of meat and poultry being offered to him   today,\\\\\" said Rodney Leonard, executive director of the Community   Nutrition Institute.       \\\\\"Company management is less concerned about the risk to   health than about raising plant output and company profits,\\\\\"   Leonard told a hearing of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on   Livestock, Dairy and Poultry.       Kenneth Morrison, staff associate at the Government   Accountability Project, said inspectors consistently disclose   violations of federal law, demonstrating a \\\\\"serious breakdown in   the entire inspection system.\\\\\"       Morrison told of chicken fat for flavoring being   contaminated by \\\\\"intestines dragging in a water trough used to   flush away the condemned product, fecal material, human spit,   chewing gum and paper towels used by plant employees to blow   their noses.\\\\\"       Donald Houston, administrator of the U.S. Agriculture   Department\\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service, FSIS, defended   the government\\'s program, calling it \\\\\"one of the most respected   public health programs in the world.\\\\\"       FSIS inspects an estimated 127 mln head of cattle and 4.5   billion chicken and turkeys every year.       Houston said inspection programs have kept pace with   change, but conceded that the danger of chemical residues in   the meat and poultry supply has increased.       He also said that, although he was confident the bacterium   salmonella eventually could be eradicated, it would take time   and much money to contain the growing problem.       Salmonella, which in extreme cases can cause death, is   found in approximately 37 pct of U.S. broilers, 12 pct of raw   pork and three to five pct of raw beef, Houston said.       The number of reported cases has doubled over the past 20   years, he said, to 40,000 cases annually.       \\\\\"We certainly really have not found an effective means of   turning this disease around,\\\\\" said Rep. James Olin (D-Va.)       The National Research Council recommended in 1985 that FSIS   intensify efforts to develop rapid diagnostic procedures for   detecting microoganisms.       But the meat and poultry industries have said such controls   would cost too much.       \\\\\"Hopefully we will not overreact by installing unnecessarily   complicated procedures that may become obstacles to the real   goal of providing an increasingly safer, more nutritious and   economical meat supply for consumers,\\\\\" Stanley Emerling,   executive vice president of the National Association of Meat   Purveyors, said.       Blaylock, speaking on behalf of food inspectors, said a new   program allowing elimination of USDA inspection functions at   certain plants \\\\\"voids the law in letter and spirit, and must be   repealed or we will see rising consumer fraud and an epidemic   of death and illness for which there will be no prevention nor   legal recourse.\\\\\"       Subcommittee Chairman Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) said the   panel would hold a hearing on salmonella June 2.     \", \"U.S. EXPORT BONUS POULTRY FEED FOR NORTH YEMEN   The Commodity Credit Corporation   (CCC) accepted a bid for an export bonus to cover the sale of   7,000 tonnes of mixed poultry feed to North Yemen, the U.S.   Agriculture Department said.       The department said the feed is for delivery during April.       As announced earlier the bonus was 90.00 dlrs per tonne,   made to The Pillsbury Company and will be paid in the form of   commodities from CCC stocks.        An additional 143,000 tonnes of mixed poultry feed are   still available to North Yemen under the Export Enhancement   Program announced April 14, 1986, it said.     \", \"ESTIMATED U.S. POULTRY SLAUGHTER   The United States department of   agriculture estimated live poultry slaughter for the week   ending April 1  as follows, in thousands -               Current      Previous    Class      week         week    Bro/Fry      92,552      95,563     Lt Fowl       2,840       3,354     Hvy Fowl        651         789     Check Total  96,043      99,706      \", \"EXOTIC NEWCASTLE DISEASE IN MD/NEW YORK-USDA   Exotic Newcastle, a highly contagious   disease of pet birds and poultry, has been confirmed in two   pet-bird dealer facilities in Maryland, and New York, the U.S.   Agriculture Department said.       The department said no domestic poultry are involved in the   outbreak.       State quarantines have been placed on the two facilities,   in Hunt Valley, Maryland, and Schenectady, New York.       The most serious U.S. outbreak of the disease occurred in   1971-73 in southern California, where the disease spread from   infected pet birds to a dense poultry population and nearly 12   mln birds, mostly laying hens, were destroyed at a cost of 56   mln dlrs, the department said.     \", \"U.S. MEAT GROUP TO FILE TRADE COMPLAINTS   The American Meat Institute, AME,   said it intended to ask the U.S. government to retaliate   against a European Community meat inspection requirement.       AME President C. Manly Molpus also said the industry would   file a petition challenging Korea\\'s ban of U.S. meat products.       Molpus told a Senate Agriculture subcommittee that AME and   other livestock and farm groups intended to file a petition   under Section 301 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade   against an EC directive that, effective April 30, will require   U.S. meat processing plants to comply fully with EC standards.     \", \"CCC GUARANTEES TO TURKEY SWITCHED TO MEALS-USDA   The Commodity Credit Corporation,   CCC, has reallocated 15.0 mln dlrs in credit guarantees to   Turkey previously earmarked for sales of U.S. oilseeds to   provide coverage for sales of U.S. protein meals in fiscal year   1987, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.       The department said the action reduces the guarantee line   authorized for sales of oilseeds to 5.0 mln dlrs from 20.0 mln   dlrs and creates the new line for protein meals.       All sales under the credit lines must be registered and   exports completed by September 30, 1987, it said.     \", \"USDA TO CONDUCT SURVEY FOR AVIAN INFLUENZA   U.S. Agriculture Department animal   health officials are conducting a national survey of live-bird   markets and auctions to check for signs of avian influenza, an   infectious viral disease of poultry, the department said.       The survey will locate poultry dealers and live-bird   markets that sell live birds directly to the consumer and once   the dealers and markets are identified, there will be tests to   determine any past or present exposure to avian influenza   viruses, it said.       In 1983-84, an outbreak of avian influenza in Pennsylvania,   Maryland, Virginia and New Jersey cost taxpayers 65 mln dlrs to   control and required the destruction of more than 17 mln birds,   it said.       The survey is expected to be completed by April 15.     \", \"INDONESIA/TURKEY ELIGIBLE FOR CATTLE UNDER EEP   U.S. exporters will be able to sell   8,000 head of dairy cattle to Indonesia and 5,000 head to   Turkey under the Export Enhancement Program, the U.S.   Agriculture Department said.       The export sales will be subsidized with commodities from   the inventory of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), the   department said.       Indonesia and Turkey already have purchased 7,500 and 5,000   head of dairy cattle, respectively, under the program.       Details of the program and an invitation for offers from   exporters will be issued in the near future, it said.     \", \"BOTSWANA BANS ZIMBABWE MEAT PRODUCTS, AGENCY SAYS   Botswana has stopped importing almost   all meat products from Zimbabwe after reports of a suspected   outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the neighbouring country.       Botswana\\'s official news agency, BOPA, announcing the ban   last night, quoted Agriculture Minister Daniel Kwelagobe as   saying only sterilised and canned animal products would be   allowed into the country, with immediate effect.       He said Zimbabwean veterinary officials had notified him   that they suspected foot and mouth disease had broken out at   Insiza, 100 km northeast of Bulawayo, capital of the mainly   cattle-ranching southwestern province of Matabeleland.       Zimbabwean officials were not immediately available for   comment.       The ban will affect products such as uncanned meat, milk,   ham, butter and bacon, BOPA reported.       Botswana exports much of its high-grade beef to the   European Community and augments its local supplies with meat   imports from Zimbabwe.     \", \"U.K. OFFICIALS STUDY SALMONELLA/CALF FEED LINK   U.K. Officials are studying the possible   link between the use of antibiotics in calf feeds and the   spread of drug-resistant strains of salmonella in humans, a   Ministry of Agriculture official said.       A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine   yesterday stated that the spread of an unusual strain of   salmonella that is resistant to the drug chloramphenicol had   been shown to be linked to farms that used the drug to promote   the growth of cattle.      The U.K. Ministry of Agriculture is working with the   Department of Health and the Public Health Laboratory to   investigate the whole subject of resistant strains of   salmonella.       \\\\\"The Ministry of Agriculture is concerned about the possible   effects on human and animal health,\\\\\" the official said. The   government is also studying a recommendation from the Farm   Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) to restrict the trade of calves   under 56 days old through markets. The FAWC says this would   help reduce the spread of salmonella.     \", \"CCC GUARANTEES TO IRAQ SWITCHED --USDA   The Commodity Credit Corporation   (CCC) has transferred 12.0 mln dlrs in credit guarantees   previously earmarked for sales of U.S. hatching eggs and 7.0   mln dlrs in guarantees for breeder livestock to increase   coverage on sales of U.S. protein concentrates to Iraq, the   U.S. Agriculture Department said.       The action was taken at the request of Iraq\\'s State Trade   Organization for Grains and Foodstuffs and reduces the line for   hatching eggs to zero and the line for breeder livestock from   15.0 mln dlrs to 8.0 mln dlrs, the department said.       The guarantee line for sales of protein concentrates has   been increased from 25.0 mln dlrs to 44.0 mln dlrs, it said.     \", \"HAITI ALLOWS IMPORTATION OF BANNED BLACK PIGS   Haiti\\'s agriculture minister   yesterday announced his department will permit the importation   of 730 black Creole pigs, which had been banned from the island   nation since 1983.       Between 1981 and 1983, a team of Canadian veterinarians   funded by the United States, Canada, Mexico and Costa Rica   supervised the slaughter of all Haiti\\'s 1,200,000 pigs under a   program to eradicate African swine flu.       Today\\'s announcement that Catholic Relief Services   (CARITAS) can import 730 Jamaican pigs comes after months of   protests by farmers who had owned 90 pct of the slaughtered   pigs.     \", \"CCC ACCEPTS BONUS BID ON CATTLE FOR EGYPT - USDA   The Commodity Credit Corporation has   accepted a bid for an export bonus to cover the sale of 760   head of dairy cattle to Egypt, the U.S. Agriculture Department   said.       The delivery period for the cattle is April, 1987-June,   1988, it said.       The bonus of 1,870.00 dlrs per head was made to Esmah   Nevada Inc and will be paid in the form of commodities from the   CCC inventory.       An additional 7,199 head of dairy cattle are still   available to Egypt under the Export Enhancement Program   initiative announced September 12, 1986, the department said.     \", \"CANADA THREATENS BAN ON DANISH PIGMEAT IMPORTS   Canada has threatened to stop imports   of Danish pigmeat from July 14 after Canadian veterinary   inspectors approved only two of 33 slaughterhouses, a Danish   agriculture ministry official told Reuters.       The Canadians postponed the original July 1 deadline at the   request of the European Commission, which Denmark approached   for support.       Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said in an   interview with the daily Berlingske Tidende: \\\\\"Denmark will not   accept a ban on Danish meat exports, and I am sure we can reach   an understanding with the Canadians with the help of the EC.\\\\\"       Danish pigmeat exports to Canada were worth 106 mln crowns   in 1986, while Canadian exports to the European Community   totalled about 6.5 billion U.S. Dlrs.       Some Danish slaughterhouse officials expressed suspicion   that the Canadian action was in response to tightening up by EC   veterinary inspectors on Canadian food exports to the EC.       But an official at the Canadian embassy in Copenhagen said   the inspection of Danish slaughterhouses was based on EC   regulations. \\\\\"Canadian officials are very concerned about the   trade implications. We are holding active discussions with the   EC and bilaterally,\\\\\" she added.     \", \"CCC ACCEPTS EXPORT BONUS DAIRY CATTLE TO MOROCCO   The Commodity Credit Corporation,   CCC, has accepted a bonus offer from an exporter on the sale of   13 head of dairy cattle to Morocco, the U.S. Agriculture   Department said.       The department said the bonus awarded was 1,505.00 dlrs per   head and was made to Brown Swiss Enterprises Inc. It will be   paid in the form of commodities from CCC inventories.       The cattle are for delivery during March 9-September 30,   1987.

       " (['CHICKEN NOT MAIN SALMONELLA CAUSE, OFFICIAL SAYS   A representative of the poultry   industry said statistics showed that chicken is less frequently   the cause of salmonella poisoning than beef, dairy products or   salads and other mixed foods.       Kenneth May, President of Holly Farms Poultry Industries   and a director of the National Broiler Council, told a House   Agriculture subcommittee the incidence of salmonella in chicken   has not increased in recent years and that chicken is neither   the major source of the bacterial poisoning nor the cause of an   increase in outbreaks of the disease.       May said the Center for Disease Control figures showed that   between 1978 and 1982, chicken was involved in four pct of all   U.S. salmonellosis outbreaks, while beef accounted for ten pct   of outbreaks and dairy products six pct.       May said the remaining outbreaks were caused by salads and   mixed food, turkey, seafood, pork, eggs and other foods.       May said the chicken industry favored moving away from   bird-by-bird inspection procedures to a risk assessment system   better able to identify microbial and bacterial contamination   of poultry.       However, Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice for   Food and Health Policy, said bird-by-bird inspection should be   retained and labels should be attached to each ready-to-cook   chicken to remind consumers about preparation procedures   necessary to avoid illness.       Haas also called for a review of present chicken industry   inspection methods that she said can worsen poultry hazards.     ',\n",

       "   'EX-USDA OFFICIAL URGES CHICKEN HANDLING LABELS   A former U.S. Agriculture Department   official urged the department to require that packages of   chicken be labeled with handling and cooking instructions to   protect the public from disease.       Carol Tucker Foreman, President of Foreman and Heidepriem   and a former assistant secretary of agriculture for food and   consumer services, told a House Agriculture subcommittee, \"every   hour of every day, 22 Americans become victims of chicken   contaminated with salmonella.\"       She said every two and a half weeks, an American dies of   salmonellosis or complications arising from it and the   incidence of poisoning from poultry has increased steadily over   the past several years.       Foreman said USDA should follow a National Academy of   Sciences recommendation to label chicken packages to remind   consumers of preparation procedures necessary to avoid illness.       She urged USDA to require that birds be washed thoroughly   before they are defeathered and that defeathering machines be   cleaned several times a day, that birds be condemned if their   intestines are punctured or there is visible fecal   contamination and that chiller water be changed more often.       Kenneth Blaylock, President of the American Federation of   Government Employees, said a poultry industry recommendation to   move away from the current bird-by-bird inspection could prove   \"disastrous.\" He said a strengthened bird-by-bird inspection with   slower line speeds was the foundation upon which new inspection   techniques should be overlaid.

       "   'U.S. MEAT, POULTRY INSPECTION CALLED FAULTY   The U.S. meat and poultry inspection   programs are incapable of protecting consumers from   contaminated products, groups representing inspectors and   consumers charged.       \"The whole trend of inspection for the last 10 years has   been to corrupt and to degrade the system where today the   public is at constant risk to contaminated and adulterated   meat,\" Kenneth Blaylock, president of the American Federation of   Government Employees, told a House Agriculture subcommittee.       \"The American consumer has little reason to feel confident   about the safety of meat and poultry being offered to him   today,\" said Rodney Leonard, executive director of the Community   Nutrition Institute.       \"Company management is less concerned about the risk to   health than about raising plant output and company profits,\"   Leonard told a hearing of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on   Livestock, Dairy and Poultry.       Kenneth Morrison, staff associate at the Government   Accountability Project, said inspectors consistently disclose   violations of federal law, demonstrating a \"serious breakdown in   the entire inspection system.\"       Morrison told of chicken fat for flavoring being   contaminated by \"intestines dragging in a water trough used to   flush away the condemned product, fecal material, human spit,   chewing gum and paper towels used by plant employees to blow   their noses.\"       Donald Houston, administrator of the U.S. Agriculture   Department\\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service, FSIS, defended   the government\\'s program, calling it \"one of the most respected   public health programs in the world.\"       FSIS inspects an estimated 127 mln head of cattle and 4.5   billion chicken and turkeys every year.       Houston said inspection programs have kept pace with   change, but conceded that the danger of chemical residues in   the meat and poultry supply has increased.       He also said that, although he was confident the bacterium   salmonella eventually could be eradicated, it would take time   and much money to contain the growing problem.       Salmonella, which in extreme cases can cause death, is   found in approximately 37 pct of U.S. broilers, 12 pct of raw   pork and three to five pct of raw beef, Houston said.       The number of reported cases has doubled over the past 20   years, he said, to 40,000 cases annually.       \"We certainly really have not found an effective means of   turning this disease around,\" said Rep. James Olin (D-Va.)       The National Research Council recommended in 1985 that FSIS   intensify efforts to develop rapid diagnostic procedures for   detecting microoganisms.       But the meat and poultry industries have said such controls   would cost too much.       \"Hopefully we will not overreact by installing unnecessarily   complicated procedures that may become obstacles to the real   goal of providing an increasingly safer, more nutritious and   economical meat supply for consumers,\" Stanley Emerling,   executive vice president of the National Association of Meat   Purveyors, said.       Blaylock, speaking on behalf of food inspectors, said a new   program allowing elimination of USDA inspection functions at   certain plants \"voids the law in letter and spirit, and must be   repealed or we will see rising consumer fraud and an epidemic   of death and illness for which there will be no prevention nor   legal recourse.\"       Subcommittee Chairman Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) said the   panel would hold a hearing on salmonella June 2.
