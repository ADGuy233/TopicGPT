Kenneth May, President of Holly Farms Poultry Industries   and a director of the National Broiler Council, told a House   Agriculture subcommittee the incidence of salmonella in chicken   has not increased in recent years and that chicken is neither   the major source of the bacterial poisoning nor the cause of an   increase in outbreaks of the disease.       May said the Center for Disease Control figures showed that   between 1978 and 1982, chicken was involved in four pct of all   U.S. salmonellosis outbreaks, while beef accounted for ten pct   of outbreaks and dairy products six pct.       May said the remaining outbreaks were caused by salads and   mixed food, turkey, seafood, pork, eggs and other foods.       May said the chicken industry favored moving away from   bird-by-bird inspection procedures to a risk assessment system   better able to identify microbial and bacterial contamination   of poultry.       However, Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice for   Food and Health Policy, said bird-by-bird inspection should be   retained and labels should be attached to each ready-to-cook   chicken to remind consumers about preparation procedures   necessary to avoid illness.

Kenneth Morrison, staff associate at the Government   Accountability Project, said inspectors consistently disclose   violations of federal law, demonstrating a \\\\\"serious breakdown in   the entire inspection system.\\\\\"       Morrison told of chicken fat for flavoring being   contaminated by \\\\\"intestines dragging in a water trough used to   flush away the condemned product, fecal material, human spit,   chewing gum and paper towels used by plant employees to blow   their noses.\\\\\"       Donald Houston, administrator of the U.S. Agriculture   Department\\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service, FSIS, defended   the government\\'s program, calling it \\\\\"one of the most respected   public health programs in the world.\\\\\"       FSIS inspects an estimated 127 mln head of cattle and 4.5   billion chicken and turkeys every year.       Houston said inspection programs have kept pace with   change, but conceded that the danger of chemical residues in   the meat and poultry supply has increased.       He also said that, although he was confident the bacterium   salmonella eventually could be eradicated, it would take time   and much money to contain the growing problem.       Salmonella, which in extreme cases can cause death, is   found in approximately 37 pct of U.S. broilers, 12 pct of raw   pork and three to five pct of raw beef, Houston said.       The number of reported cases has doubled over the past 20   years, he said, to 40,000 cases annually.       \\\\\"We certainly really have not found an effective means of   turning this disease around,\\\\\" said Rep. James Olin (D-Va.)       The National Research Council recommended in 1985 that FSIS   intensify efforts to develop rapid diagnostic procedures for   detecting microoganisms.       But the meat and poultry industries have said such controls   would cost too much.       \\\\\"Hopefully we will not overreact by installing unnecessarily   complicated procedures that may become obstacles to the real   goal of providing an increasingly safer, more nutritious and   economical meat supply for consumers,\\\\\" Stanley Emerling,   executive vice president of the National Association of Meat   Purveyors, said.       Blaylock, speaking on behalf of food inspectors, said a new   program allowing elimination of USDA inspection functions at   certain plants \\\\\"voids the law in letter and spirit, and must be   repealed or we will see rising consumer fraud and an epidemic   of death and illness for which there will be no prevention nor   legal recourse.\\\\\"       Subcommittee Chairman Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) said the   panel would hold a hearing on salmonella June 2.     \", \"U.S. EXPORT BONUS POULTRY FEED FOR NORTH YEMEN   The Commodity Credit Corporation   (CCC) accepted a bid for an export bonus to cover the sale of   7,000 tonnes of mixed poultry feed to North Yemen, the U.S.   Agriculture Department said.       The department said the feed is for delivery during April.

The department said no domestic poultry are involved in the   outbreak.       State quarantines have been placed on the two facilities,   in Hunt Valley, Maryland, and Schenectady, New York.       The most serious U.S. outbreak of the disease occurred in   1971-73 in southern California, where the disease spread from   infected pet birds to a dense poultry population and nearly 12   mln birds, mostly laying hens, were destroyed at a cost of 56   mln dlrs, the department said.     \", \"U.S. MEAT GROUP TO FILE TRADE COMPLAINTS   The American Meat Institute, AME,   said it intended to ask the U.S. government to retaliate   against a European Community meat inspection requirement.

The survey will locate poultry dealers and live-bird   markets that sell live birds directly to the consumer and once   the dealers and markets are identified, there will be tests to   determine any past or present exposure to avian influenza   viruses, it said.       In 1983-84, an outbreak of avian influenza in Pennsylvania,   Maryland, Virginia and New Jersey cost taxpayers 65 mln dlrs to   control and required the destruction of more than 17 mln birds,   it said.       The survey is expected to be completed by April 15.     \", \"INDONESIA/TURKEY ELIGIBLE FOR CATTLE UNDER EEP   U.S. exporters will be able to sell   8,000 head of dairy cattle to Indonesia and 5,000 head to   Turkey under the Export Enhancement Program, the U.S.   Agriculture Department said.

Botswana\\'s official news agency, BOPA, announcing the ban   last night, quoted Agriculture Minister Daniel Kwelagobe as   saying only sterilised and canned animal products would be   allowed into the country, with immediate effect.

Zimbabwean officials were not immediately available for   comment.       The ban will affect products such as uncanned meat, milk,   ham, butter and bacon, BOPA reported.       Botswana exports much of its high-grade beef to the   European Community and augments its local supplies with meat   imports from Zimbabwe.     \", \"U.K. OFFICIALS STUDY SALMONELLA/CALF FEED LINK   U.K. Officials are studying the possible   link between the use of antibiotics in calf feeds and the   spread of drug-resistant strains of salmonella in humans, a   Ministry of Agriculture official said.       A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine   yesterday stated that the spread of an unusual strain of   salmonella that is resistant to the drug chloramphenicol had   been shown to be linked to farms that used the drug to promote   the growth of cattle.      The U.K. Ministry of Agriculture is working with the   Department of Health and the Public Health Laboratory to   investigate the whole subject of resistant strains of   salmonella.       \\\\\"The Ministry of Agriculture is concerned about the possible   effects on human and animal health,\\\\\" the official said. The   government is also studying a recommendation from the Farm   Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) to restrict the trade of calves   under 56 days old through markets. The FAWC says this would   help reduce the spread of salmonella.     \", \"CCC GUARANTEES TO IRAQ SWITCHED --USDA   The Commodity Credit Corporation   (CCC) has transferred 12.0 mln dlrs in credit guarantees   previously earmarked for sales of U.S. hatching eggs and 7.0   mln dlrs in guarantees for breeder livestock to increase   coverage on sales of U.S. protein concentrates to Iraq, the   U.S. Agriculture Department said.       The action was taken at the request of Iraq\\'s State Trade   Organization for Grains and Foodstuffs and reduces the line for   hatching eggs to zero and the line for breeder livestock from   15.0 mln dlrs to 8.0 mln dlrs, the department said.

The Canadians postponed the original July 1 deadline at the   request of the European Commission, which Denmark approached   for support.

Some Danish slaughterhouse officials expressed suspicion   that the Canadian action was in response to tightening up by EC   veterinary inspectors on Canadian food exports to the EC.       But an official at the Canadian embassy in Copenhagen said   the inspection of Danish slaughterhouses was based on EC   regulations. \\\\\"Canadian officials are very concerned about the   trade implications.

       "   'U.S. MEAT, POULTRY INSPECTION CALLED FAULTY   The U.S. meat and poultry inspection   programs are incapable of protecting consumers from   contaminated products, groups representing inspectors and   consumers charged.       \"The whole trend of inspection for the last 10 years has   been to corrupt and to degrade the system where today the   public is at constant risk to contaminated and adulterated   meat,\" Kenneth Blaylock, president of the American Federation of   Government Employees, told a House Agriculture subcommittee.       \"The American consumer has little reason to feel confident   about the safety of meat and poultry being offered to him   today,\" said Rodney Leonard, executive director of the Community   Nutrition Institute.       \"Company management is less concerned about the risk to   health than about raising plant output and company profits,\"   Leonard told a hearing of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on   Livestock, Dairy and Poultry.       Kenneth Morrison, staff associate at the Government   Accountability Project, said inspectors consistently disclose   violations of federal law, demonstrating a \"serious breakdown in   the entire inspection system.\"       Morrison told of chicken fat for flavoring being   contaminated by \"intestines dragging in a water trough used to   flush away the condemned product, fecal material, human spit,   chewing gum and paper towels used by plant employees to blow   their noses.\"       Donald Houston, administrator of the U.S. Agriculture   Department\\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service, FSIS, defended   the government\\'s program, calling it \"one of the most respected   public health programs in the world.\"       FSIS inspects an estimated 127 mln head of cattle and 4.5   billion chicken and turkeys every year.       Houston said inspection programs have kept pace with   change, but conceded that the danger of chemical residues in   the meat and poultry supply has increased.       He also said that, although he was confident the bacterium   salmonella eventually could be eradicated, it would take time   and much money to contain the growing problem.       Salmonella, which in extreme cases can cause death, is   found in approximately 37 pct of U.S. broilers, 12 pct of raw   pork and three to five pct of raw beef, Houston said.       The number of reported cases has doubled over the past 20   years, he said, to 40,000 cases annually.       \"We certainly really have not found an effective means of   turning this disease around,\" said Rep. James Olin (D-Va.)       The National Research Council recommended in 1985 that FSIS   intensify efforts to develop rapid diagnostic procedures for   detecting microoganisms.       But the meat and poultry industries have said such controls   would cost too much.       \"Hopefully we will not overreact by installing unnecessarily   complicated procedures that may become obstacles to the real   goal of providing an increasingly safer, more nutritious and   economical meat supply for consumers,\" Stanley Emerling,   executive vice president of the National Association of Meat   Purveyors, said.       Blaylock, speaking on behalf of food inspectors, said a new   program allowing elimination of USDA inspection functions at   certain plants \"voids the law in letter and spirit, and must be   repealed or we will see rising consumer fraud and an epidemic   of death and illness for which there will be no prevention nor   legal recourse.\"       Subcommittee Chairman Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) said the   panel would hold a hearing on salmonella June 2.

The department said no domestic poultry are involved in the   outbreak.       State quarantines have been placed on the two facilities,   in Hunt Valley, Maryland, and Schenectady, New York.       The most serious U.S. outbreak of the disease occurred in   1971-73 in southern California, where the disease spread from   infected pet birds to a dense poultry population and nearly 12   mln birds, mostly laying hens, were destroyed at a cost of 56   mln dlrs, the department said.

The department said the action reduces the guarantee line   authorized for sales of oilseeds to 5.0 mln dlrs from 20.0 mln   dlrs and creates the new line for protein meals.

The survey will locate poultry dealers and live-bird   markets that sell live birds directly to the consumer and once   the dealers and markets are identified, there will be tests to   determine any past or present exposure to avian influenza   viruses, it said.       In 1983-84, an outbreak of avian influenza in Pennsylvania,   Maryland, Virginia and New Jersey cost taxpayers 65 mln dlrs to   control and required the destruction of more than 17 mln birds,   it said.

Botswana's official news agency, BOPA, announcing the ban   last night, quoted Agriculture Minister Daniel Kwelagobe as   saying only sterilised and canned animal products would be   allowed into the country, with immediate effect.       He said Zimbabwean veterinary officials had notified him   that they suspected foot and mouth disease had broken out at   Insiza, 100 km northeast of Bulawayo, capital of the mainly   cattle-ranching southwestern province of Matabeleland.       Zimbabwean officials were not immediately available for   comment.       The ban will affect products such as uncanned meat, milk,   ham, butter and bacon, BOPA reported.

A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine   yesterday stated that the spread of an unusual strain of   salmonella that is resistant to the drug chloramphenicol had   been shown to be linked to farms that used the drug to promote   the growth of cattle.      The U.K. Ministry of Agriculture is working with the   Department of Health and the Public Health Laboratory to   investigate the whole subject of resistant strains of   salmonella.       \"The Ministry of Agriculture is concerned about the possible   effects on human and animal health,\" the official said. The   government is also studying a recommendation from the Farm   Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) to restrict the trade of calves   under 56 days old through markets.

The Canadians postponed the original July 1 deadline at the   request of the European Commission, which Denmark approached   for support.       Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said in an   interview with the daily Berlingske Tidende: \"Denmark will not   accept a ban on Danish meat exports, and I am sure we can reach   an understanding with the Canadians with the help of the EC.\"       Danish pigmeat exports to Canada were worth 106 mln crowns   in 1986, while Canadian exports to the European Community   totalled about 6.5 billion U.S. Dlrs.
