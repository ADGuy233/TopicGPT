       "  \" Think!  It's the SCSI card doing the DMA transfers NOT the disks...  The SCSI card can do DMA transfers containing data from any of the SCSI devices it is attached when it wants to.  An important feature of SCSI is the ability to detach a device. This frees the SCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to start transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the bus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data.  On an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked the data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time. \",\n",

[Would I kid you?]   Does one man\\'s words encompass the majestic vision of thousands of individuals?  Quoting a man is not the same as quoting the Order.  Taken out of context, words can be interpreted much differently than had one applied them within the confines of their original expression.  I think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior  of the Order to which I belong.  When he included that bit from Merlinus X\\' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremes to which Order members have been known to go in their fervor. I have little knowledge regarding Reuss\\' background, but surely he was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order  for many years.  Yet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back so carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is only the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed which extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that there was and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order itself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.   Let us examine this issue a bit more closely....  \"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist and paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo Templi Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he met three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.   Kellner\\'s efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz Hartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together prior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902 in Reuss\\'s Masonic publication, \\'Oriflamme\\'.  On Kellner\\'s death, Reuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The \\'Jubilee\\' edition of the \\'Oriflamme\\', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught secret of sexual magic.   \"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in Augsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and possibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist League founded by Karl Marx\\'s daughter and her husband.  Reuss was later associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden Dawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to found the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several attempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the development of the O.T.O.  \"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss\\' leadership. For example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin and H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between Reuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and accused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh, the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for the first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all the English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked when publishing the material of the Equinox.  \"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a stroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when _The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break in the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O. over the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order. He had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss\\'s request, deeply infusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\"  _An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX\\'  Within _Equinox III:10_, Edited by    Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,     Caliph of the United States of America,       Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.    There are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this material in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not? Why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own organization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle of Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very complex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room for very many interpretations.  It is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived out of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters with an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I can take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble support of the \\'Law of Thelema\\' is laughable at best.  Would I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?   Will I?   I think not. Why?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection I am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things in the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be quite difficult to apprehend at first.  So it may be with OTO and Merlinus X\\'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully. I do not support Reuss\\'s words myself, as I am not qualified to assess them, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of the Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then what can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that the Order has \\'gone soft\\' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or does it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of universal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic requirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?   I find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis. They are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane or usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.   Having met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or were very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity of the organization as it stands.  I have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments  I followed my intuition, and I\\'ve found little to stop me from requesting a Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I\\'m happily participating in social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic Mass well enough for my tastes.    This doesn\\'t make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however. I can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my limited contact with other members.  I urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many ways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with the Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom and the preservation of individual vision.  I welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response to other posts in this thread.   Invoke me under my stars.  Love is the law, love under will.  I am I!',\n",

       "  ' The Supreme Court seems to disagree with you -- they have stated that \"the people\" is a term of art refering to an individual right, and have explicitly mentioned the second amendment as an example.  I quote:    \"... \\'the people\\' seems to have been a term of art employed in   select parts of the Constitution.  The Preamble declares that the   Constitution is ordained, and established by \\'the people of the   the U.S.\\'  The Second Amendment protects the right of the people   to keep and bear Arms ....\"  - Supreme Court of the U.S.,  U.S. v. Uerdugo-Uriquidez (1990).  Furthermore, in the Miller decision, they only permitted prosecution for possession of a sawed-off shotgun because the defense had not presented testimony and they therefore accepted the argument of the government that such weapons have no military value -- they held that the amendment protected the individual right to possess military weapons. Unfortunately, no second amendment case has successfully gotten to the court in fifty years. However, that does not change the interpretation.  Furthermore, it appears that others disagree with you as well, vis:   \"The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept,   and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the   United States, as well as its interpretation by every major   commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratifi-   cation, indicates that what is protected is an individual right   of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner.\"    - Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the      Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate,      97th Congress, Second Session ( February 1982 )  You might rightfully ask \"well then, what does that first bit about militias mean?\"  Well, \"militia\" in historical context basically means the whole of the adult males of the country. (Indeed, the U.S. Code still defines \"militia\" as all armed men over the age of 17).     \"The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting     in concert for the common defense ....  And ... these men were     expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of     the kind in common use at the time.\"  - Supreme Court of the United States,  U.S. v. Miller (1939).  The reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationale behind the amendment, which was this: by depending on the people to bear arms in defense of the country, no centralization of military power could ever occur which would permit tyranny -- in short, the government would remain perpetually in fear of the people, rather than the other way around.     \"No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.  The strongest reason    for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last    resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.\"      - Thomas Jefferson, Proposal Virginia Constitution, June 1776        1 Thomas Jefferson Papers, 334 (C. J. Boyd, Ed., 1950).     \"And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not    warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of    resistance ?  Let them take arms ... The tree of liberty must be    refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\"      - Thomas Jefferson (letter to William S. Smith, 1787, in        Jefferson, On Democracy 20, S. Padover, ed., 1939).     \"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed;    as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe.  The supreme    power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword;    because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute    a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on    any pretense, raised in the United States.\"      - Noah Webster, \"An Examination into the Leading Principles        of the Federal Constitution\" (1787), in Pamphlets on the        Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).  You may disagree with the second amendment, and wish that it be repealed, but please do not pretend that it isn\\'t there and that it doesn\\'t mean what it says. You might argue that conditions have changed and that it should no longer be present, but you can\\'t imagine it away.  I could fill a book with detailed argumentation. Many have already.

       "  ':  : I am considering buying a 1993 Chevy or GMC 4x4 full-size pickup with : the extended cab.  Any opinions about these vehicles?  Have there been : any significant problems? :  : --  : Dick Grady           Salem, NH,  USA            grady@world.std.com : So many newsgroups, so little time!   I bought a brand new 1992 Chevrolet K2500 HD 4x4 extended cab last May.  It has had many, many problems.  See my earler post that describes the situation.  I went to BBB arbitration, and they ruled that Chevrolet must buy it back from me.  If you do get one, stay away from the 5 speed manual with the deep low first gear.  They have put three of them in my truck so far.  After about 1,500 miles, overdrive either starts rattling or hissing loudly.  There is no way to fix them.  Chevrolet  says that the noise is \"a characteristic of the transmission.\"  Also, if you are planning to use your truck to tow, the gear ratios in that tranny suck.  On a steep hill, you get up to about 55 MPH in second gear at 4,000 RPM (yellow line).  If you shift to third, the RPM drop to only 2,500, and you begin to loose speed.  I should point out that the 350 V8 they put in the HD (8600 GVW) trucks is a detuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones.  They dropped the compression ratio, supposedly for \"engine longevity\" reasons.  So the light duty 350 may pull better than my truck does. Other things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan (3 times  so far), paint (had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being shipped by rail with no covering), and suspension parts (link between stabilizer and control arm fell off).  Any company can make a bad individual car, Chevrolet included.  What really bothered me was the way they reacted.  They made no attempt to deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for  them to attempt to fix it one more time.  So I bought a brand new Ford F250 HD Super Cab with a 460 and an automatic.  I will never buy another Chevrolet.',\n",

       "  '[ . . .]  I am a relativist who would like to answer your question, but the way you phrase the question makes it unanswerable.  The concepts of \"right\" and \"wrong\" (or \"correct/incorrect\" or \"true/false\") belong to the domain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes no sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is legitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).  Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives of epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively. One can certainly ask if a percept is \"right\" (correct, true, veridical) or \"wrong\" (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes little sense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it is strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can certainly ask that question about motives.  Therefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can\\'t be considered: they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.  Now the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree with the first part (that the \"rightness\" of a moral position is a meaningless question), for the reasons stated above.  But that is irrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that one cannot feel peace is better than war.  I certainly can make value judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the \"correctness\" of the position.  Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).  My short (e) answer is that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue, neither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect).  They simply hold different moral values (feelings).',\n",

I   know they've given units to the Florida Highway Patrol, County Sheriff's a   and some local governments. The real question is why? This is the hook. GEICO, and other Ins.

Most   drivers do not represent increased risk even after a ticket or two, but    this gives them the opportunity to RAISE RATES FOR EQUAL RISK. It's called   extra profits. They also know how silly the NSL is, and how it is almost   universally ignored. Driving in excess of the NSL gets you a ticket, an   increase in your rates, points on your license --- but it doesn't make you   a riskier driver to insure. Like the sound of this?

       "  ' A word of warning, though:  Kryptonite also sells almost useless cable locks under the Kryptonite name.  When I obtained my second motorcycle, I migrated one of my Kryptonite  U-locks from my bicycle to the new bike.  I then went out shopping for a new lock for the bicycle.  For about the same money ($20) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock (advantages: lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both, Kryptonite name) or a cheesy no-name U-lock (advantages: real steel). I chose the Kryptonite cable.  After less than a week, I took it back in disgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock.  First, the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite, is not covered by the Kryptonite guarantee, and doesn\\'t even approach Kryptonite standards of quality and quality assurance.  It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cable lock with the Kryptonite name on it.  Secondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke.  I don\\'t know if mine was a particularly poor example, but it was often quite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage, and sometimes it would seem to engage, only to fall open when I went to unlock it.  Thirdly, the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves the sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the  dark.  I didn\\'t try it (obviously), but I have my doubts that the  lock mechanism would stand up to an \"insert screwdriver and TORQUE\" attack.  Fourthly, the cable was not, in my opinion, of sufficient thickness to  deter theft (for my piece of crap bicycle, that is).  All cables suffer the weakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time.  If you are patient you can cut cables with fingernail clippers.  Aviation snips would go  through the cable in well under a minute.    -- ',\n",

       "  \"completed  Why would you dispose a channel if you are going to play more sounds soon? If you are trying to write a game, you shouldn't be using SndPlay. Instead, make a channel and use BufferCmds to play sounds on it. It works great. You can add CallBacks to the channel also to let you know when the channel is getting empty. Before it gets empty.  7.1,  Callbacks are very reliable, I found them 100% reliable, even under System 4.1. I was doing continuous background sound with interrupting sound effects on System 6.0 with the IM-V documentation.  You probably were cancelling your callback commands out of your channels, of course you didn't get called. In general, if you have problems with sounds working when you play one per channel and then close the channel (with the related slowdown), but then when you play more than one you don't work, then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a channel, possibly the same one multiple times. This might be because you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with a sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to the channel first thing before it plays. Most sampled sounds have this command at the start of them. You need to resedit the sound and remove that command, then when you create your channel, specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the channel's synth. Then you can use asynch sndplay's all you want. You'll probably want to switch to BufferCmd's, since you are going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add callbacks.  Now before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it, and the sound manager doesn't work for games, remember, Spectre uses it. And it works great. If Spectre can spare the CPU time, you can too.  One little disclaimer: There are some out there who say the Sound Manager in the IIsi can't be made to work right.

Assuming the most favorable interpretation of your '1000 degree' measurement (that the temperature is in Centigrade, rather than the more common -in the US- Fahrenheit), you are still laboring under at least 2 misconceptions:  1.  You seem to believe that steel melts somewhere around 1000 C.     Actually, the melting point of most iron alloys (and steels are     iron alloys) is in the neighborhood of 1400 C.  Even if the gun     were found in area which achieved the 1000 C temperature, the steel     parts of the gun would not be deformed, and it would still be     trivial to identify the nature of the weapon.  2.  A fire is not an isothermal process.  There are 'hot' spots and     'cold' spots, though 'cold' is purely a relative term.

We did steal that one dirctly from the Germans.  The difference is that swept wings don't change their angle of sweep, sweep wings do.  Perhaps the similarity of names has caused some confusion?  747s have swept wings, F-111s have sweep wings.   Phil> A lot of this was also done by the military...

Dryden was involved in the flight testing of winglets and area ruling (in the 70s and 50s, respectively).  It's true that we used military aircraft as the testbeds (KC-135 and YF-102) but that had more to do with availability and need than with military involvement.  The YF-102 was completely ours and the KC-135 was bailed to us.  The Air Force, of course, was interested in our results and supportive of our efforts.  Dryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the 70s. No mechnaical or analog backup, to show you how confident we were. General Dynamics decided to make the F-16 flyby-wire when they saw how successful we were.  (Mind you, the Avro Arrow and the X-15 were both fly-by-wire aircraft much earlier, but analog.)

       "  \"SREBRENICA'S DOCTOR RECOUNTS TOWN'S LIVING HELL       By Laura Pitter     TUZLA, Bosnia, Reuter - Neret Mujanovic was a pathologist when he trekked through the mountains to the besieged Muslim town of Srebrenica last August.     But after treating 4,000 mangled victims of Bosnia's bloody war, he considers himself a surgeon.     ``Now I'm a surgeon with great experience although I have no license to practice. But if I operate on a person and he lives normally that's the greatest license a surgeon could have.''     Evacuated by the U.N. this week to his home town of Tuzla, the Muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment of the horrors of the year-long Serb siege of Srebrenica and the suffering of the thousands trapped there.     ``I lived through hell together with the people of Srebrenica. All those who lived through this are the greatest heroes that humanity can produce,'' he told reporters.     Mujanovic, 31, had practiced for two months as an assistant at a local hospital in Tuzla, but before going to Srebrenica he had never performed a surgical operation on his own. Now he says he has performed major surgery 1,396 times, relying on books for guidance, amputating arms and legs 150 times, usually without anesthetic, delivering 350 babies and performing four cesarean sections.     He worked 18-to-19-hour days, slept in the hospital for the first 10 weeks after his arrival last Aug. 5 and treated  4,000 patients.     He arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot from Tuzla, 60 miles northwest of Srebrenica. About 50 other people carried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected him through guerrilla terrain, he said.     His worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven Serb shells landed within one minute in an area half the size of a football field, killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102. Half of the dead were women and children.     The people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the children were playing soccer. ``There was no warning ... the blood flowed like a river in the street,'' he said.     ``There were pieces of women all around and you could not piece them together. One woman holding her two children in her hands was lying with them on the ground dead. They had no heads.''     Before Mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions were deplorable, he said. Many deaths could have been prevented had the hospital had surgical tools, facilities and medicine.     The six general practitioners who had been operating before he arrived had even less surgical experience than he did. ``They didn't know the basic principles for amputating limbs.''     Once he arrived the situation improved, he said, but by mid-September he had run out of supplies.     ``Bandages were washed and boiled five times ... sometimes they were falling apart in my hands,'' he said. Doctors had no anesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain because it increased bleeding.     ``People were completely conscious during amputations and stomach operations,'' he said. Blood transfusions were impossible because they had no facilities to test blood types.     ``I felt destroyed psychologically,'' Mujanovic said.     The situation improved after Dec. 4, when a convoy arrived from the Belgian medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres.     But Mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in mid-December after Bosnian Serbs began a major offensive in the region. ``Every day we had air strikes and shellings.''     Then the hunger set in.     Between mid-December and mid-March, when U.S. planes began air dropping food, between 20 and 30 people were dying every day from complications associated with malnutrition, he said.     ``I know for sure that the air drop operation saved the people from massive death by hunger and starvation,'' he said.     According to Mujanovic, around 5,000 people died in Srebrenica, 1,000 of them children, during a year of siege.     Mujanovic plans to return to Srebrenica in three weeks after visiting his wife, who is ill in Tuzla.     ``They say I'm a hero,'' he said. ``There were thousands of people standing at the sides of the road, crying and waving when I left. And I cried too.'' \",\n",

       "  '  First of all, \"ceremonial law\" is an extraScriptural term.  It is sometimes used as a framework to view Scripture.  But if you look at Collosions, without going into it with the assumption that the Sabbath cannot be  a ceremonial law, you will see that it does refer to the sabbath.  against us to His cross, and therefore we should not be judged in what what food we eat, what we drink, the keeping of new moons and holy days, or the keeping of the sabbath.  The word for sabbath in this verse is \"sabbaton\" and is used throughout the New Testament to refer to the 7th day.  If there is any Scripture from which we get the idea of the ceremonial law, this is one of them, and the sabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws.  If one goes into this with the fundamental assumption \"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law\" then he will have to find some way around it, like saying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the 7tH day, Because \"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law.\"  But Paul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal  statement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin in his writings.  Also, why is the sabbath absent from the epistles (except for Hebrews 4, which talks about the rest that comes through faith?)  Surely it would have been a big problem for first century Christians living in a society that did not rest on the 7th day.  Especially slaves. Many new converst were slaves.  It would have been difficult for slaves to rest on the sabbath if it had been mandatory.  Why is there no mention of this in the epistles?',\n",

A lower court had banned the local Gideons, an international Bible- distribution group, from passing out Bibles to fifth-graders. The ACLU\\'s Barry Lynn was quoted as saying that the court\\'s action protected the \"religious neutrality of our public schools.\" He also said that schools must serve students of \"all faiths and none.\" Schools were not to be a \"bazaar where rival religious groups compete for converts,\" according to Lynn.  Several Gideons, men who are responsible for putting Bibles in hospitals and hotels, are members of our church. They tell of similar stories where they are only allowed to distribute Bibles on sidewalks around the schools, but cannot go inside the schools. They tell of mild harassment by parents who do not want their children receiving a Bible from a stranger. They are willing to continue their work at a distance, but find the school\\'s position somewhat disheartening.  I understand rationally and logically the court\\'s position. And, I can see the sense of fairness for all groups. But, on the other hand, when does \"neutrality\" become \"nihilism?\" When does plurality turn into no position at all?  I see a couple of ironies here. One is that we can pass out condoms but not Bibles in our schools. Think on that one for a moment.  The other is that while we are seeking \"religious neutrality\" in our schools, countries like Russia--who, by the way, practiced \"religious neutrality\" for the past seventy years--are making the  Bible part of their public school curriculum. When I was in St. Petersburg in March, the church we worked with had trained over 100 public school teachers to teach the Bible, and the government had requested hundreds more! I recently heard a medical doctor who is president of the Gideon chapter in Moscow tell how they are eagerly invited to the University of Moscow to distribute Bibles to the students and are given class time to explain its contents. I remember seeing a photograph of this doctor holding a Bible and speaking to the university students standing under a statue of Lenin. Now, that\\'s ironic!  I admit two things: 1) We are a pluralistic society, and all faiths have equal footing. This is what our country was founded on. 2) To allow every group on school grounds could create a bazaar-like atmosphere. Each city must work to be inclusive of all religions and provide a hearing for them. 3)--I know I said two--The vitality of religious faith is not dependent upon whether or not the public arena acknowledges it as valid.  However--and you knew this was coming--I believe, disallowing the distribution of the Bible by law-abiding, caring adults in our schools only signals once again our culture\\'s movement away from a singular base from which we as individuals and as a nation can make moral and ethical decisions.

Source: Cemal Kutay, \"Ottoman Empire,\" vol. II., p. 188.      \"The atrocities and massacres which have been committed for a long time  against the Muslim population within the Armenian Republic have been   confirmed with very accurate information, and the observations made by  Rawlinson, the British representative in Erzurum, have confirmed that  these atrocities are being committed by the Armenians. The United States  delegation of General Harbord has seen the thousands of refugees who came   to take refuge with Kazim Karabekir\\'s soldiers, hungry and miserable,   their children and wives, their properties destroyed, and the delegation  was a witness to the cruelties. Many Muslim villages have been destroyed  by the soldiers of Armenian troops armed with cannons and machine guns  before the eyes of Karabekir\\'s troops and the people. When it was hoped  that this operation would end, unfortunately since the beginning of   February the cruelties inflicted on the Muslim population of the region  of Shuraghel, Akpazar, Zarshad, and Childir have increased. According  to documented information, 28 Muslim villages have been destroyed in the  aforementioned region, more than 2,000 people have been slaughtered,  many possessions and livestock have been seized, young Muslim women  have been taken to Kars and Gumru, thousands of women and children who  were able to flee their villages were beaten, raped and massacred in the  mountains, and this aggression against the properties, lives, chastity   and honour of the Muslims continued. It was the responsibility of the  Armenian Government that the cruelties and massacres be stopped in order   to alleviate the tensions of Muslim public opinion due to the atrocities   committed by the Armenians, that the possessions taken from the Muslims  be returned and that indemnities be paid, that the properties, lives,  and honour of the Muslims be protected.\"   Serdar Argic',\n",
       "  \"[discussing the use of IRQ 7]    To put it a little differently:   - IRQ 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the    printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity.   - DOS doesn't monitor IRQ 7; it uses other means to determine when it's    time to send out another byte to the printer.   - Most (all?) (hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable    the use of IRQ 7, usually by merely breaking the connection between    the ISA pin and the associated driver.  Other adapters control the    IRQ line by a tri-state driver, and by programming just leave it    in the high-impedence mode.   - Unfortunately, there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate    drivers (i.e., either assert high or assert low) for the IRQ lines    rather than tristate drivers (assert high, assert low, or don't    assert anything).  The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes    the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically     disconnected by a jumper.     (Incidentally, note that there's no requirement that a card hold    the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired.  If that were true    you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected IRQ lines, and    that certainly isn't a requirement.)   - Non-DOS operating systems (OS/2, NT (?), various Unices or whatever the    proper plural of Unix might be) require the use of IRQ 7 for performance    reasons.    And the SB16, alas, is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers.\",\n",

       "  \"Well, there *is* a difference.  I don't happen to have my SAE manual handy, but oil viscosity in general _decreases_ with temperature.  The SAE numbers are based on a `typical' curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a room-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature  5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.  Oils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have a weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold place, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer, to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.  Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature. As a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating temperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).  In any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember that your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and radiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or something.  Any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized oil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature, thicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature,  but not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.    If you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine (esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you're making short drives, stick to the 10W40.  \",\n",
       "  '\"Space Station Redesign Leader Says Cost Goal May Be Impossible\"  Today (4/6) the Washington Post ran an article with the headline shown above. The article starts with \"A leader of the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned space station said yesterday the job is tough and may be impossible.\" O\\'Connor is quoted saying whether it is possible to cut costs that much and still provide for meaningful research \"is a real question for me.\" O\\'Connor said \"everything is fair game,\" including \"dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the aerospace industry, chopping management of the space station program at some NASA facilities around the country, working closely with the Russian space station Mir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the manned space shuttle fleet.\"  O\\'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options so far, and they are sorting the serious candidates into three categories based on cost.  The Post says O\\'Connor described the design derived from the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe Kathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I listened in on part of O\\'Connor\\'s briefing to the press on Monday, and in one part of the briefing O\\'Connor talked about how the White House wants three options, sorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part of the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has formed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC, modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch Core [\"wingless Orbiter\"] @ JSC. Later, in response to a reporters question, I thought I heard O\\'Connor say the option based on a SSF redesign was a \"moderate\" cost option, in between low & high cost options. Not the \"high cost\" option as Sawyer wrote).  The article goes on to describe the other two options as \"one features modules that could gradually be fitted together in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The other is a core facility that could be deposited in orbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option would use existing hardware from the space shuttle - the fuselage, for example, in its basic structure.\"',\n",

Well, anyway, it is not surprising that Armenians also collaborated with the  Nazis.   \"Wholly opportunistic the Dashnaktzoutun have been variously   pro-Nazi, pro-Russia, pro-Soviet Armenia, pro-Arab, pro-Jewish,   as well as anti-Jewish, anti-Zionist, anti-Communist, and    anti-Soviet - whichever was expedient.\"[1]  [1] John Roy Carlson (Arthur Derounian), \\'Cairo to Damascus,\\'      Alfred A.

It was based in Boston (where ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle is located) but  had followers in Armenian colonies all over the world. Literally Tzeghagron means \\'to make a religion of one\\'s race.\\' The architect of the Armenian Racial Patriots was Garegin Nezhdeh, a Nazi Armenian who became a key leader of collaboration with Hitler in World War II. In 1933, he had been invited to the United States by the Central Committee of the Dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the  American-Armenian youth. Nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many local Armenian youth groups in the Tzeghagrons. Starting with 20 chapters in the initial year, the Tzeghagrons grew to 60 chapters and became the largest and most powerful Nazi Armenian organization. Nezhdeh also provided the Tzeghagrons with a philosophy:   \"The Racial Religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity.   Race above everything and before everything. Race comes first.\"[1]  [1] Quoted in John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), \"The     Armenian Displaced Persons,\" in \\'Armenian Affairs,\\' Winter,     1949-50, p. 19, footnote.   Now wait, there is more.  THE GRUESOME extent of February\\'s killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about 600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.  The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.  The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken Azerbaijan\\'s wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000 dead.  The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \"Hojali Disaster\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.  FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \"We  did  not count  the bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\" Mr Zen Ruffinen said. \"We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead.\"  Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the number of  dead in the  massacre. \"Don\\'t  get worked up.  It will take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\" the  43-year-old lawyer said at his small office.  Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990.  Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.  Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the republic\\'s forensic department. \"This  is just a small percentage of the dead,\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic\\'s chief forensic scientist. \"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours.\"  Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov\\'s report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.  Files  from  Mr  Rasulov\\'s  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 February.  \"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\" Mr Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot.  \"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return.\"  There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces.

       "  'May 13, 1993  _Five Russian soldiers sentenced to death in Azerbaijan_   MOSCOW (UPI) -- Five soldiers who served in Russia\\'s 7th army stationed in Armenia were sentenced to death in the Azerbaijani capital Baku Thursday for allegedly \"carrying out diversions and killing 30 Azeri soldiers.\"   A statement released by the news service of Azeri President Abulfaz Elchibey said \"the sentence was final and was not subject to protest or appeal,\" the  Russian state news agency Itar-tass reported.   But the Russian Foreign Ministry issued an appeal for the men to be handed over to the authorities in Moscow for punishment.   \"This would accord with modern standards of humanity towards those who have committed crimes,\" the statement reads.   The five men, together with another soldier who received a 15-year prison sentence, were captured in September 1992 by Azeri police in the Kelbadzhar district of Azerbaijan, between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia.   The Supreme Court in Baku said the men had gone through special training in a company of the Russian 7th army in the Armenian capital Yerevan, after which they were sent across the Armenian-Azeri border into Nagorno-Karabakh to  carry out diversions against Azeri troops.   However, the Russian Foreign Ministry statement claimed they had deserted the Russian army and were fighting as mercenaries with Armenian armed forces in the battle zone round Karabakh.   Nagorno-Karabakh is an Armenian-populated enclave within Azerbaijan which for five years has been fighting for independence from Baku in a war that has left many thousands dead and uprooted hundreds of thousands from their homes.   Both Yerevan and Baku have always claimed that Russian servicemen stationed in these Caucasian republics, who were left behind after the break-up of the  Soviet Union, are fighting as mercenaries in the Karabakh war.   The statement from Moscow said the Russian side repeatedly appealed to the Azerbaijani government to show humanity and leniency in their treatment of the six men, and to hand them over to the Russian authorities.   It said that President Boris Yeltsin himself sent a letter with this request  to his Azeri counterpart Elchibey. Itar-tass said that the soldiers\\' defense attorneys had lodged an appeal for clemency.      ',\n",

       "  '[heats of formation deleted]  The major problem with this is that the reaction takes place in an ACID solution. PbSO4 is soluble in an acid solution and will not precipitate out.  Also, H2SO4 is in a water solution as 2H30+ and SO4--.  Thus the heats of formation of PbSO4 and H2SO4 are for the most part irrelevant.   As it turns out the reaction is indeed exothermic (heat producing). (More about this later.)  What actually happens to make the battery completely useless is this: (we\\'re talking lead-acid batteries of course) The battery slowly self discharges.  As this discharge takes place two things happen. -The level of Pb++ ions in the acid solution increases (i.e. the lead            and lead oxide plates are dissolved).         -The level of H30+ ions in the acid solution decreases (i.e. the solution            becomes less acidic, or more like water if you like). Now, as the post to which I am responding correctly stated, PbSO4 will precipitate in a WATER (non-acid) solution.  When the battery dies (i.e. is fully discharged) we end up with a high concentration of Pb++ and SO4-- in water.  So PbSO4 forms in the solution and FALLS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BATTERY (of course this happens in varying degrees, the more discharged, the more precipitate forms).  The precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery.  If there is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate (more common in a newer battery) a dead short results.  I have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition, but they are for the most part useless.  They can dissolve the PbSO4 but cannot restore the lead and lead oxide plates properly.  You may have some success with these products for a newer battery.  [stuff deleted] [stuff deleted]  This stuff is just made up by the author and is completely invalid. In fact the discharge reaction takes place at a higher rate at higher temperatures.  A logical consequence of the above argument is this: \"If you really want your car to start, lower the battery temperature to  -50 to \\'pull\\' the reaction along.\"  We all know from experience (at  least those of us in Canada do (it gets cold up here)) that this is not true.  If we want to start our car on a really cold day we warm the battery.  (Besides which, there is not enough energy released through self discharge  to appreciably raise the temperature.  The air would amply dissipate any  such heat, whether the bottom of the battery was insulated or not.  This  is of course irrelevant, since you would WANT the battery to be cool  during storage.)',\n",

Chiu knows the score and is just being silly. However, \"decibel\" is in fact 1/10th of a bel. He is right on that one, but I don\\'t know if it was accidental or not.  Strictly defined, a bel is the ratio of the log of two power levels, and a decibel is 1/10th of a bel so you have 10X decibels for every bel, hence bel=log(P2/P1) and decibel=10Xlog(P2/P1).  The bel, ohm, volt, farad, ampere, watt, hertz, henry, etc. are all named for pioneers in the field. It\\'s a traditional and fine way to honor researchers who discover new knowledge in a new field. Hertz was one of the most important of the early electronics explorers, but had been left out in having a term or unit named after him until recently, (1960\\'s, prior to that what is now a hertz was a cps.) All the other units were defined many decades earlier.       --  ----------------------------------------------------------------------    ',\n",

There are plenty of scenarios where the user would have no idea what something is either.  It could be uninitialized junk.  The burden of proof is on the user to show that it's something a normal upstanding citizen should have.  No one should ever be put in that situation, especially in America.  What's disgusting about this is how easily most people go along with it, to provide a bargaining chip against some hypothetical *alleged* child molester or drug dealer, or whatever bad thing is in style at the time.  Basically most people don't have a clear distinction between criminals and suspects.  As an analogy, it's like they find a loose screw in your house, and they insist that you're building a bomb or machine gun.  They ask you where it came from (like you'd know), and ask you to prove your claim.  When you explain it in such simple terms, people may start to get the idea.  As a matter of fact, i do keep random files on my disk.  The reason is, without special-purpose hardware, it takes a long time to generate good random bits.  I have programs that crank out a couple bits per minute, which is pretty conservative, but over time that's more than i need.  If you think about it, there's no point in actually encrypting random data, because it just gives you different random data.  If you want some data to look like an encrypted file, you just put an appropriate header on it.  If enough people do this, some of them will be put in jail.  When you get arrested and the police ask for your keys, you can tell them it's just random junk, although of course they won't believe you.

Prince has never hit well in the minors and he's now 27 years old, I think.  Pagnozzi was not a bad hitter in the minors.  (I'll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I don't have another brain cramp and forget.)  He had a very good year at Louisville  before coming up to the majors.  As I recall, the hype on Pagnozzi coming up in the organization was good hit, decent fielding.  When he got to the  majors and didn't hit as well as expected (not as much playing time?), he  became Exhibit 312 in Nichols' Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation  as an outstanding defensive catcher.  It's not clear he ever learned to hit.  His four years with more than 100 AB--  Born 31 July 1962 Year     AB      BA     SLG     OBA   1988    195    .282    .320    .328 1990    220    .277    .373    .321 1991    459    .264    .351    .317 1992    485    .249    .359    .290   No power, less-than-league-average walks, peak year when he turned 28,  now declining.  If Ted is going to invoke Pagnozzi as a model for Prince, given that Prince has underperformed Pagnozzi in the minors, it's not a rosy picture.  BTW, I'm still unhappy with moving Zeile, who had the same reputation  coming up in the Cardinal organization as Pagnozzi, except that he was a much, much better hitter, to 3rd where he could be an average hitter and a below average fielder instead of a well-above average hitter as an average (or below average) fielding catcher.

       "  ' A question for you - can you give me the name of an organization or a philosophy or a political movement, etc., which has never had anything evil done in its name?  You\\'re missing a central teaching of Christianity - man is inherently sinful.  We are saved through faith by grace.  Knowing that, believing that, does not make us without sin.  Furthermore, not all who consider themselves \"christians\" are (even those who manage to head their own \"churches\").  \"Not everyone who says to me, \\'Lord, Lord,\\' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.\" - Matt. 7:21.   Again, what historical documents do you trust?  Do you think Hannibal crossed the Alps?  How do you know?  How do you know for sure?  What historical documents have stood the scrutiny and the attempts to dis- credit it as well as the Bible has?   Well, it\\'s really a shame you feel this way.  No one can browbeat you into believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving you further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions: 1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain it.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this salvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain modern offshoots like the \"new age movement\" teach or does he require God\\'s help?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such help come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for some people it did comprise their life\\'s writings, so I am hardly in a position to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.  Few, of us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives (certainly not me). The spritual life is a difficult journey (if you\\'ve never read \"A Pilgrim\\'s Progress,\" I highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english language).   Now I see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be a conflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing.  You wrote that \"I (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not most of the teachings of christ\".  Well, Christ referred to God as \"My Father\", not \"My Mother\", and while the \"maleness\" of God is not the same as the maleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not honor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory, or politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent to do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women -  english just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).  After all, God chose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the human population.  Well, I\\'m not about to launch into a detailed discussion of the role of women in Christianity at 1am with only 6 hours of sleep in the last 63, and for that reason I also apologize for any shortcomings in this article.

       "  'Government-Mandated Energy Conservation is Unnecessary and Wastful, Study Finds    Washington, DC -- The energy tax and subsidized energy-efficiency   measures supported by President Clinton and Energy Secretary Hazel   O\\'Leary are based on faulty assumptions, a new study from the Cato   Institute points out.      According to Jerry Taylor, Cato\\'s director of natural resource studies,   we are not running out of sources of energy. The world now has almost 10   times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of   1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as   dramatically.      When standards of living, population densities, and industrial   structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy   efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group   of Seven nations.      Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil   price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the   cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,   even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the   overall U.S. economy.      Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per   $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies.      Utilities\\' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side   management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource   inputs, an competitive inequities. Furthermore, DSM programs do not   reduce demand.      Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes   unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that   subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance,   gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood   of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state   at the expense of the individual.      \"Energy Conservation and Efficiency: The Case Against Coercion\" is no.   189 in the Policy Analysis series published by the Cato Institute, an   independent public policy research organization in Washington, DC.    Available from:   Cato Institute   224 Second Street SE   Washington, DC  20003    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                             The Cato Institute      Founded in 1977, the Cato Institute is a public policy research   foundation dedicated to broadening the parameters of policy debate   to allow consideration of more options that are consistent with the   traditional American principles of limited government, individual   liberty, and peace.  To that end, the Institute strives to achieve   greater involvement of the intelligent, concerned lay public in    questions of policy and the proper role of government.     The Institute is named for Cato\\'s Letters, libertarian pamphlets   that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early 18th   century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation   of the American Revolution.     Despite the achievement of the nation\\'s Founders, today virtually   no aspect of life is free from government encroachment.  A pervasive   intolerance for individual rights is shown by government\\'s arbitrary   intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for   civil liberties.     To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive   publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy   issues.  Books, monographs, and shorter studies are commissioned   to examine the federal budget, Social Security, regulation, military   spending, international trade, and myriad other issues.  Major policy   conferences are held throughout the year, from which papers are   published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal.     In order to maintain its independence, the Cato Institute accepts   no government funding.  Contributions are received from foundations,   corporations, and individuals, and other revenue is generated from   the sale of publications.  The Institute is a nonprofit, tax-exempt,   educational foundation under Section 501(c)3 of the Internal Revenue   Code.',\n",

       "  '  Brian K., I am pleased with your honesty.  And to be honest as well, I believe you have not asked my god to come to you.  Why do I say this? Because by the things you write on the net, and the manner with which you write them, you show me that you made up your own god and are attempting to pass him off as the real thing.  I got news for you. Yours doesn\\'t at all sound like mine.  Your god doesn\\'t come to you because your god doesn\\'t exist.   I am sorry Brian, but when I read your postings, I do not see an open mind. What I do see is misunderstanding, lack of knowledge, arrogance and mockery.   Be true to yourself then.  Have an open mind.  And so end the mockery.  Gain  knowledge of the real God.  Put your presumptions aside.  Read the Bible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything and there exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond our shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself   to seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a person who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find  something to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one will gain with that attitude is folly.  Be careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages in the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even though they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not. Be assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such deep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied.  I will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, \"You will never be thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over.\"   From King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):      \"It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;      to search out a matter is the glory of kings.\"   Jesus says in John 6:44 & 55:     \"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.\"   And in John 3:16:     \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,    that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal    life.\"   You are included in \"whosoever\".  And I also pray that the Father is drawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn\\'t be posting to talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in the making.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasure stoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul became on of the most celebrated men in the history of God\\'s church.  You see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, because you could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attack Christians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul, proclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.  Or you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would  probably say to you: \"Satan would surely like to have you.\"  Why so? Because Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated great moments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a task he did with full heart.  Peter was the only apostle to have the faith to walk on water as Jesus did.  You asked \"Why not believe in Zeus?\"  Zeus didn\\'t offer eternal life. You got nothing to gain by believing in Zeus.

       "  '[insert deletion of unnecessary quote]   First of all, God does not take any sort of pleasure from punishing people.  He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion on whom he will have compassion (Ex 33:19).  However, if he enjoyed punishing people and sending them to hell, then why would he send Jesus to \"seek and save that which was lost\" (Luke 19:10)?  You asked for it.  2 Peter 2:4-ff talks about how those who are ungodly are punished. Matthew 25:31-46 is also very clear that those who do not righteous in God\\'s eyes will be sent to hell for eternity. 2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 states that those who cause trouble for the disciples \"will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord\". 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 talks about those who refuse to love the truth being condemned. Revelation 21:6-8 talks about the difference between those who overcomes and those who do not.  Those who do not, listed in verse 8, will be in the \"fiery lake of burning sulfur\". Revelation 14:9-12 gives the indication that those who follow the beast \"will be tormented with burning sulfur\" and there being \"no rest day or night\" for them because of it. Psalm 9:17:  \"The wicked return to the grave, all the nations that forget God.\"  I think those should be sufficient to prove the point.   Joe Fisher  [In the following I\\'m mostly playing \"devil\\'s advocate\".  I\\'m not advocating either position.  My concern is that people understand that it\\'s possible to see these passages in different ways.  It\\'s possible to see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev often uses the term \"second death\".  The most obvious understanding of that would seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaks both of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms that can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince you of one view or the other, but to help people understand that there\\'s a wide enough variety of images that it\\'s possible to understand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary point is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire, whatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35 implies that the damned don\\'t get resurrected at all.  Presumably they just stay dead. -- yes I\\'m aware that it\\'s possible to  understand this passage in a non-literal way.)  2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them in hell until the final judgement.  This isn\\'t eternal punishement.  Matthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is eternal doesn\\'t mean that people will last in its flames forever. Particularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been prepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the eternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet will be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being thrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as \"the second death\". This sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible that the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as the devil, and humans?  2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is \"everlasting destruction\"? This is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be understood either way, but I think it\\'s at least possible to think that everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction that can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in eternity.  2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction. Revelation 21:6-8: see comment above Revelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there, it doesn\\'t explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It says that the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that  there is no respite from it.  But it doesn\\'t say that the people are tormented forever.  Psalm 9:17:  I don\\'t see that it says anything relevant to this issue.',\n",

My daughter's Christian school sends home a weekly update on school related topics. This week they sent something *very* interesting. It was an article written by the leader of a national (US) Christian school organization about a trip he recently made to Jerusalem. While there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is working on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. The article included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the specifications given in the Bible.   What was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are complete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli government before beginning the building. The other startling fact is the very recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is unoccupied and available for building. Previously it has been thought that the original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuilding impossible without sparking a holy war.   Now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming sacrifices, as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days. Although the Israeli government will give the permission to start, I think it is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let it happen. Brothers and sisters, the time is at hand.

It is a REAL problem.  And we, as  motorcyclists, can be in the worst of vulnerable positions around a drunk driver.  (Alert readers might remember that last year I witnessed a DWI accident (right bloody in front of me), and was unable to save the life  of one of the participants, as I reported here.)  Also, drunk driving by motorcyclists is a prime cause of their injury and death, which raises the insurance rates, forces stupidly restrictive laws, and turns the public against those of us who ride responsibly.  In my view, drunk driving should carry a mandatory prison sentence. It is one of the traffic offenses which is NOT a public funds issue, but a genuine safety issue.

It turns out that clever orbital mechanics can  engineer things so that resonant interactions with the higher order  harmonics of the Earth's gravitational field can pump energy into a  satellite, and keep it from experiencing drag effects for periods of  months to years.

       "  \"From Denning:     the Skipjack encryption algorithm    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    N, a 30-bit serial number    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip     E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and     E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.    Where the session key is K, and is transmitted encrypted in the unit Key U. Which along with the serial number N is encrypted in the Family key F.  Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential analysis).  Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel.  The function of this spoof chip is twofold:       1) Transmit Channel       The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with      a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number      unrecoverable with just the family key   2) Receive Channel       The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number      with a secondary keying variable (assuming integrity of the      law enforcement block is necessary for local operation -      checksums, sequence control, etc.).  This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  It is probable theere is a known plaintext pattern used as a filler in the block containing N (34 bits as used in generating U, U1,U2) correctness of the law enforcement block can be determined with only the family key F.  Whereas, no one has proposed Federal Agencies be denied F, and because they could recover it themselves, The correctness of the serial number can be tested by examining the pad bits of N in E[N; F].  The one could selectively alter the law enforcement block as above, but the mutilation could be detected.  A better approach would be to mutilate the entire law enforcement block.  If it were done with a group encryption scheme such as DES or (presumably) Skipjack, the chances the law enforcement block can be recovered are lessened.  What do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and the serial numbers decrypted in a target search?  When digital transmission becomes widely available, would there be a requirement that clipper protocol transmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks?  One way to avoid notice, would be to spoof protocol information of the block containing M, as well as spoofing the law enforcement block.  The goal is to use a secure communications scheme, without redress to  detection or key K interception (contained encrypted within the law enforcement block).  The data stream is returned to its original state for use by the clipper chip (or system) if required, for proper operation.  It is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained within the clipper chip, yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for, requiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before accepting and decrypting E(M; K);  The spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols, including on the resulting serial data stream.  Existing clipper products could be subborned.  After all, they are high security encryption systems right?  Super encipherment/encryption could allow the chip to be used without redress to detection of the use of the chip, or disclosure of the serial number.  Security must be adequate to deny the serial number, which should not be recoverable by other means.  One can see the use of cut outs for procurring clipper phones, or once the number of units is high enough, stealing them.  It would be a mistake on the part of authority, but nice from a point of privacy, if the serial number N were not associated with a particular clipper chip or lot of chips through the manufacturing and  distribution process.  Hopefully the list of known missing or stolen clipper serial numbers N encrypted with F, and the protocols are not  sufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypted clipper stream. This could be further made difficult by altering the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encrypted stream.  Detection of an encrypted stream could tip off the use of the aforementioned scheme.  ******************************************************************************  If you could capture valid law enforcement blocks not your own, and use them in a codebook sustitution with your own, where they point to a valid law enforcement block stored in a library utilizing a session key matching the remainder of the transmission, you could simply out and out lie, yet deliver to monitoring and/or hostile forces a seemingly valid law enforcement block.   These captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators, such as in a manually keyed encryption system.  Fending this off would require escalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission.  The M code stream  might be independently attacked based on knowledge of clipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext.  This could be invalidated by changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper M stream and the actual transmitted stream, under the control of a secure key generator synchronized between endpoints.  The useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited based on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission interception.  You would need a large number of them, but, hey there's supposed to be millions of these things, right?  Adding time stamps to the encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical, who wants an encryption chip with a real time clock?  *****************************************************************************\",\n",

       "  'I differ with our moderator on this.  I thought the whole idea of God coming down to earth to live as one of us \"subject to sin and death\" (as one of the consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer (1979) puts it) was that Jesus was tempted, but did not succumb.  If sin is not part of the basic definition of humanity, then Jesus \"fully human\" (Nicea) would not be \"subject to sin\", but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning, because we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin.  To distinguish between \"human\" and \"fallen human\" makes Jesus less like one of us at the time we need him most.   First, the Monophysites inherited none of Nestorius\\'s version -- they  were on the opposite end of the spectrum from him.  Second, the historical record suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as extreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history) claimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing (I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean, in the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son \"uncreate\" -- surely even  Arians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius\\'s opponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed that she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require two seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because Mary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely, if you accept \"Nestorianism\" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined, a la Chalcedon.  Second, I am not sure that \"Nestorianism\" is not a better alternative than the orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus\\'s human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think rather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate nature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine nature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature prevailed.  Comments on the above warmly appreciated.  Jason Albert  [There may be differences in what we mean by \"subject to sin\".  The original complaint was from someone who didn\\'t see how we could call Jesus fully human, because he didn\\'t sin.  I completely agree that Jesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by not succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do not have to sin in order to be human.  I again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I agree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there\\'s reason to think that not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in fact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was not Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of the correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he got the better of them.  However, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to Chalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least \"rash and dogmatic\" (as the editor of \"The Christological Controversy\" refers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As regular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an impediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I think are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from Cyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says \"To attribute also to [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics of the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother, either the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the Greeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and Apollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the idea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine Logos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some degree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his fearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off on the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us who perpetrate the falsehood.\"  It\\'s all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between humanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based on exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have \"to some degree\" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it must be understood that there\\'s a certain indirectness in the Logos\\' participation in these things.  But there must be some sort of identification between the divine and human, or we don\\'t have an incarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and white terms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this area.  You say \"I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus\\'s human nature was in heaven.\"  I don\\'t think that\\'s required by orthodox doctrine.

       "  '  Actually the reasons you don\\'t see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are 1) fossil units (multiple units per plant) are generally smaller than nuclear plants.  300 MWe seemed to be a very popular size when many fossil plants were built.  The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) many fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were adopted (\"why those old dirt burners can\\'t harm anything, let \\'em go.\").   3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generally not visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossil plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.    Actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants of similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the  heat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure is normally water\\'s vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It is desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because  moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine  low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity causes erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowest pressure condensing environment is always the best.    A related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since the condenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the  condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too  hot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is a particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all costs.    The hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower  they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in the hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120  degrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water is pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer, operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order  to provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higher hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the condenser area.  At least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the air :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge water from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge water from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and humidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water temperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical \"95-95\" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East. It is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successful in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for the plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive pressure.   True.  Actually secondary plant (the part that makes electricity and feeds feedwater to the boiler) water chemistry has been the bastard  stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves. The plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood the costs of impure water.  By \"impure\", I mean water with a few dozen extra micromho of conductivity and/or a few PPM of dissolved oxygen.  Secondary water is now typically the most pure one will  find outside the laboratory.  John',\n",

       "  'Someone sent me this FAQ by E-mail and I post my response here.  [I\\'m not enforcing the inclusion limits on this FAQ because most of our readers probably haven\\'t seen it.  --clh]  Christ warns that anyone who \"breaks one of the least of these commandments *and* teaches otheres to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven\" (Matt. 5:19.  This FAQ is so full of error that I must respond to it.  I hope that whoever maintains will remove from it the partisan theology.   1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom 4:15 notes that \"where no law is, there is no transgression.\"  Not only did sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it was revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).  2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise which undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the people, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised \"what ever He says to do we will do.\"  That is why the new covenant is based on \"better promises\" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the law God promised to \"put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts\" (Heb. 8:10).  3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The Sabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt had been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been even more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly Sabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at any time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was *added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).  4.  Israel stands for God\\'s people of all time.  That is why God *grafted* the Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises belong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born into Israel is not enough \"For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel\" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says \"if ye be Christ\\'s, then are ye Abraham\\'s seed, and heirs according to the promise.\"  All Christians are Abraham\\'s seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the criterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the promise God made to all his people the Israelites.   People would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath commandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the ceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even if you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan sun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed, sanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders agree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in soc.religion.christian.bible-study). I do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God says.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law, why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the Sabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important enough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that the message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but freed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in court I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me grace, do I walk out of the court saying \"I can now go on speeding, for I am now under grace?\"  Being under grace I now drive within the speed limit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 \"Di we then make void the law through faith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\"  \"Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good\" (Rom. 7:12).   Do you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows that the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did not go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to Assos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate \"lay by him in store\" with \"go to a worship service.\"  Wrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath day of the moral law. Why would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments which conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a God who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could not be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a broken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law breaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to follow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to make false gods, to violate God\\'s name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to kill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight when placed next to the word of God.  Darius  [It\\'s not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  I think Paul\\'s comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) is probably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doing what he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equally accept that those who \"esteem all days alike\" are similarly doing their best to honor the Lord.  However I\\'d like to be clear that I do not think there\\'s unambiguous proof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I indicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.  The difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually about something else.  They both look like they are talking about nnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says \"and they gathered every Sunday for worship\".  We get various pieces of information, but nothing aimed at answering this question.    Act 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple worship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the temple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example of Christians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn\\'t tell us what day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius\\' confusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no reason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the Biblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to me that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn\\'t say they gathered to see Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread, Paul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that\\'s just not explicit enough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says that on the first day they should set aside money for Paul\\'s collection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially to do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can\\'t disprove it, but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be when they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day. So I think the most obvious reading of this is that \"on the first day of every week\" simply means every time they gather for worship.    I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian worship was.',\n",

       "  'Experiences with Diamond Viper VLB video card  Several problems:  1) The ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1MB    of VRAM, which is what I have. This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED    with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K    colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB    VRAM.  2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations:     a) Under NDW, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an       Open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often       remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to       be.     b) With Word for Windows, when you use shading in a table, the       display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example, if you       shade the cell as 10%, the display is 90% (the printout is OK).  3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development    Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger    icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command), and the    debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed    to do).

Perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to represent the full range - RGB is a cube so it is a compact encoding.  Most likely however is that there are two separate 24 bit (8 bits per component) frame buffers.

       "  'One thing that I haven\\'t seen in this thread is a discussion of the relation between IBD inflammation and the profile of ingested fatty acids (FAs).  I was diagnosed last May w/Crohn\\'s of the terminal ileum. When I got out of the hospital I read up on it a bit, and came across several studies investigating the role of EPA (an essentially FA) in reducing inflammation. The evidence was mixed. [Many of these studies are discussed in \"Inflammatory Bowel Disease,\" MacDermott, Stenson. 1992.]  But if I recall correctly, there were some methodological bones to be picked with the studies (both the ones w/pos. and w/neg. results). In the studies patients were given EPA (a few grams/day for most of the studies), but, if I recall correctly, there was no restriction of the _other_ FAs that the patients could consume. From the informed layperson\\'s perspective, this seems mistaken. If lots of n-6 FAs are consumed along with the EPA, then the ratio of \"bad\" prostanoid products to \"good\" prostanoid products could still be fairly \"bad.\" Isn\\'t this ratio the issue?  What\\'s the view of the gastro. community on EPA these days? EPA supplements, along with a fairly severe restriction of other FAs appear to have helped me significantly (though it could just be the low absolute amount of fat I eat -- 8-10% calories).',\n",
       "  ' Superficially a good answer, but it isn\\'t that simple.  An awful lot of the starvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic policies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical Westerner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible malnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can be fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans we encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre idea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they\\'ve got.  Perhaps it\\'s more accurate to say that there\\'s a Western ethic against Western infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children are dying in the Third World, we couldn\\'t give a shit.  And that goes for the supposed \"Pro-Life\" movement, too.  They could save far more lives by fighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against abortion.  Hell, if they\\'re only interested in fetuses, they could save more of those by fighting for human rights in China.  And besides, Suzanne\\'s answer implies that non-Western countries lack this ethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory forced abortion in Tibet, I don\\'t believe this to be the case. ',\n",

This demo showcases the two products in the form of a  diagram editor called DE.  Download the demo and see some of these exciting features for yourself:    o Complete on-line context sensitive help system.    o Printing support for PCL5 and PostScript.    o Rotated Text support!    o Source code for the demo is provided.  The demo is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9).  There are two versions of the demo located in the vendor/Bristol directory: Sun     - sun4.demo.tar.Z (SunOS 4.x) HP      - hp700.tar.Z     (HP-UX 8 & 9)  If you have any questions about the demo, send an e-mail to: support@bristol.com.  If you want another version of the demo (rs6000,etc...)  please send an e-mail to: info@bristol.com.  Remember to use binary mode!   What are HyperHelp and Xprinter?  Read on...... --------------------------------------------------------- Bristol Technology is proud to announce version 3.0 of its popular HyperHelp product and version 2.0 of Xprinter.         HyperHelp 3.0        ------------- HyperHelp is the de-facto standard for on-line context sensitive help in the Unix marketplace.  Through a one line function call, application developers can access the full features of HyperHelp and cut down drastically on their development time.  HyperHelp can use the same RTF, project, and bitmap files as the MS Windows Help facility. This allows a documentation department to maintain a single set of help documents portable between MS Windows, Motif and Open Look.  HyperHelp can also be authored in FrameMaker.  And with HyperHelp 3.0 Bristol introduces its SGML compiler!  New features in HyperHelp 3.0 include secondary windows,a character based viewer, segmented bitmaps, SGML support, and an improved History window.          Xprinter 2.0         ------------ Xprinter 2.0 allows developers to add sophisticated printer support to their existing/new X based applications very easily.  Xprinter uses the Xlib API for both the display and printer.  This lets you use the exact same code for drawing and printing.  Take a look at the source code for our demo and see Xprinter in action.  If you are interested in adding PostScript and PCL5 support to your application, Xprinter is the tool for you!  Earlier this year Bristola dn USL signed an agreement that resulted in Xprinter becoming the standard printing technology for UNIX SVR4.2.   Feel free to run the demo and let us know what you think about HyperHelp and Xprinter.   If you have any questions or comments, send them to us at: info@bristol.com or call us at (203) 438-6969.

ED>  ED> Elias       The above claim that you do not hate anybody may not be quite     true.  The falsity of this statement is easily visible in the     intellectual corruption that dominates everything you post in     this group.  Your complete lack of objectivity toward Israel,      and Jewish identity in general, reveal biases that indicate a     great steaming heap of hatred!          You certainly have shown a genuine hatred for honesty and for     objectivity. You repeatedly post items or quotes removed from      their original context so that they can be used to further an      agenda of rabid opposition to the very existence of Israel.      You have used this dishonest technique to paint a false image      of several Israeli leaders.  I can\\'t say if you actually HATE     these leaders, but the lies and misrepresentations of them do     suggest that you have a visceral prejudice against them.          So, while you claim that you do not hate anybody, there is an     ample body of evidence to suggest that this claim of yours is      false.  It is obvious that you hate Israel, and it is evident     that you hate the Jewish people.      And, if you are Jewish, you are a self-hating Jew.  There can     be no doubt of this.  Although you will call upon your Jewish     background in an effort to claim the high moral ground, there     is no doubt that you would like to see the Jewish people fade     away completely, as a people.  Your advocacy of intermarriage     for the purpose of dissolving the Jewish people is proof that      you hate the Jewish people.      And by your effort to superimpose the meaninglessness of your     own Jewishness on all Jews, you\\'ve clearly demonstrated to me      that you hate yourself.                                              *       *       *       *      \"Who is a Jew?

And if the bloody warrants were \"legal\" then why were they _sealed_ after the fight started? And if Koresh had declared himself a \"private state\" and was just daring the gov\\'t to go in, then why did he surrender last year to a local sheriff who served a warrant _for_his_arrest_ (as opposed to the BATF search warrant, which did not include arrest unless violations were found) by just calling him up to tell him and then going out to collect him with his squad car? That doesn\\'t sound like a dictator to me, it sounds like someone who knows he has a court battle.  Things might have gone very differently if the BATF _had_ \"rung the doorbell\".

       "  'Vera Shanti Noyes writes;   Of course I believe in Predestination.  It\\'s a very biblical doctrine as Romans 8.28-30 shows (among other passages).  Furthermore, the Church has always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to say that I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free will.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is also affected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists and Jansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with the idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4).  For God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect, who he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final perserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that those without that grace can\\'t be saved, it just means that god foreknew their obstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need it, as they had freely chosen hell.          ^^^^^^^^^^^ People who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their own effort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestined them to become saints.  But those who perish in everlasting fire perish because they hardened their heart and chose to perish.  Thus, they were deserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, and sinned against the working of the Holy Spirit.   Well, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some blessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little), for those He can\\'t bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.  And those He will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this one or in Purgatory for their sins.  Every sin incurs some temporal punishment, thus, God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it (cf. 2 Samuel 12.13-14, David\\'s sin of Adultery and Murder were forgiven, but he was still punished with the death of his child.)  And I need not point out the idea of punishment because of God\\'s judgement is quite prevelant in the Bible.  Sodom and Gommorrah, Moses barred from the Holy Land, the slaughter of the Cannanites, Annias and Saphira, Jerusalem in 70 AD, etc.  not a >good parallel, but i\\'m going to go with it anyway), why should we not >stop the murder and violation of people who may (or may not) be more  We should stop the slaughter of the innocent (cf Proverbs 24.11-12), but does that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with the U.S. or even the U.N. involved?  I do not think so, but I am an isolationist, and disagree with foreign adventures in general.  But in the case of Bosnia, I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily involved, it would not be a \"just war.\"  \"Blessed\" after all, \"are the peacemakers\" was what Our Lord said, not the interventionists.  Our actions in Bosnia must be for peace, and not for a war which is unrelated to anything to justify it for us.',\n",

Beginning with U.N. Security Council Resolution 713 of    September 25, 1991, the United Nations has been actively    addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.  The Security    Council acted in Resolution 781 to establish a ban on all    unauthorized military flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There    have, however, been blatant violations of the ban, and villages    in Bosnia have been bombed.      In response to these violations, the Security Council decided,    in Resolution 816 of March 31, 1993, to extend the ban to all    unauthorized flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and to authorize    Member States, acting nationally or through regional organi-   zations, to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance.     NATO's North Atlantic Council (NAC) agreed to provide NATO air    enforcement for the no-fly zone.  The U.N. Secretary General    was notified of NATO's decision to proceed with Operation DENY    FLIGHT, and an activation order was delivered to participating    allies.      The United States actively supported these decisions.  At my    direction, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an execute order to    all U.S. forces participating in the NATO force, for the conduct    of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by    the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The U.S. forces    initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 F-15 and    12 F-18A fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft.     These aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 8:00 a.m.    e.d.t. on April 12, 1993.  The fighter aircraft are equipped for    combat to accomplish their mission and for self-defense.      NATO has positioned forces and has established combat air    patrol (CAP) stations within the control of Airborne Early    Warning (AEW) aircraft.  The U.S. CAP aircraft will normally    operate from bases in Italy and from an aircraft carrier in the    Adriatic Sea.  Unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching    the no-fly zone will be identified, interrogated, intercepted,    escorted/monitored, and turned away (in that order).  If these    steps do not result in compliance with the no-fly zone, such    aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by    NATO military authorities and in accordance with the approved                                     more                                              (OVER) \\x0c                                   2      rules of engagement, although we do not expect such action will    be necessary.  The Commander of UNPROFOR (the United Nations    Protection Force currently operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina) was    consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully    considered before the rules of engagement were approved.      It is not possible to predict at this time how long such    operations will be necessary.  I have directed U.S. armed forces    to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional    authority as Commander in Chief.  I am grateful for the con-   tinuing support that the Congress has given to this effort, and    I look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward    toward attainment of our goals in this region.

Since then, President Clinton has directed that a number of steps  be taken to move this process forward.  The Administration is  announcing a number of steps today in order to underscore its  deep commitment to a new and closer partnership with Russia based  on its government's commitment to reform.   Executive Review of Cold War Laws  President Clinton and President Yeltsin discussed the  desirability of reviewing and updating U.S. laws and regulations  to reflect the end of the Cold War.  Congress has already acted  to revise many laws to reflect the fact that a communist Soviet  Union has been replaced by a democratic Russia and other  independent states.  However, many laws and regulations remain  that contain language and restrictions that fail to reflect the  end of the Cold War and that unnecessarily undermine relations  with Russia and the other new independent states.  The President today has ordered an Executive review of laws and  regulations so that, where appropriate and consistent with U.S.  security and other national interests, such provisions can be  revised or removed.  He has asked Ambassador-at-large Strobe  Talbott to coordinate this review on an expedited basis.  The  President has indicated that he will welcome congressional  efforts to help this review proceed as quickly as possible.  This review will weigh all considerations that pertain to  revision of such provisions, and the initiation of the review may  help to remedy some of the circumstances that have justified such  provisions in the past.  For example, because the Russians are  eager to have their status changed under the Jackson-Vanik  legislation, President Yeltsin personally assured President  Clinton in Vancouver that he would look into individual cases  involving continuing restrictions on emigration from Russia.  By  addressing such issues, this review can help strengthen the bonds  of trust and partnership between the U.S. and Russia, and between the U.S. and the other new independent states.   Review of COCOM  It is also time to consider expeditiously with America's allies  the future of another Cold War institution -- the Coordinating  Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM).  The United  States has begun a thorough review of how to reorient export  controls to the post-Cold War world, in which Russia is no longer  viewed as a potential adversary, but as a potential ally in  combatting the proliferation of sensitive technology.  Steps to Improve the Security Relationship  The President also has taken steps to move ahead on a range of  efforts discussed in Vancouver that can strengthen U.S. security  and improve our security relationship with the Russians and the  other states.   Accelerated Deactivation of Nuclear Weapons  In Vancouver, the two Presidents discussed accelerating the  process of deactivating nuclear strategic systems scheduled for  elimination under the START I Treaty.  President Clinton has  directed the Department of Defense to complete this process well  in advance of the seven year reduction period outlined in START  I.  In addition, the United States, together with Russia and the  other relevant states of the former Soviet Union, will be  exploring programs under Nunn-Lugar to help them to accelerate  this process.   Multilateral Test Ban  The two Presidents agreed at Vancouver that negotiations on a  multilateral nuclear test ban should commence at an early date,  and that the two governments would consult with each other  accordingly.  The United States looks forward to beginning  consultations with Russia, our allies, and other states, on the  specific issues related to this negotiation.  The United States  expects to start this consultative process within the next two  months.       Detargeting  The two Presidents also began a dialogue on the issue of nuclear  targeting at Vancouver.  As the United States and Russia move  into a new relationship of strategic partnership, there is a need  to reexamine many of the assumptions and means employed in the  past to safeguard U.S. security against a nuclear adversary.  The  Administration is beginning a comprehensive review of measures  that could enhance strategic stability, including recent  proposals for detargeting nuclear missiles.     Other Measures to Create a New Security Relationship  In response to the incident involving a collision between US and  Russian submarines last month, Secretary Aspin will be ready to  discuss ways to avoid such incidents in the future with Russian  Defense Minister Grachev during his visit to the United States in  late May.  Secretary Aspin will also be prepared to move forward with  Defense Minister Grachev in May to develop a combined training  program between our two military forces and to prepare for joint  exercises in peacekeeping, such as that authorized by the UN  Security Council.  The United States looks forward to broadening  such training and exercises to include other peacekeeping  contributors, in order to improve inter-operability, readiness,  and planning for multilateral peacekeeping operations.  The US  and Russia are working together to convene a May Ministerial  Meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss proposals for  enhancing the UN's peacekeeping capability and to move  consideration of the Secretary-General's Agenda for Peace from  the discussion to the implementation phase.  The U.S. is also  working with the Russians to focus specifically on improvements  in the financing and management of UN operations.  The purpose of  these initiatives will be to cooperate on peacekeeping for our  participation in UN or CSCE sponsored actions.   Multilateral and Bilateral Partnership with Reform  Finally, the Administration continues to move ahead on a range of  initiatives aimed at striking a partnership with economic and  political reformers throughout Russia and the other states.  The  Administration is continuing work with our G-7 partners to  assemble the package of multilateral assistance that Secretaries  Bentsen and Christopher recently negotiated in Tokyo.  And the  Administration is continuing consultation with Congress over the  further efforts the U.S. will take to assist the process of  reform in Russia and the other states.                             *    *    *  The Administration believes these steps can increase American  security while improving the relationship between the U.S. and  Russia, and between the U.S. and the other new independent  states.\",\n",

       "  'WASHINGTON - A stark reminder of the Holocaust--a speech by Nazi  SS leader Heinrich Himmler that refers to \"the extermination of the Jewish race\"--went on display Friday at the National Archives.  The documents, including handwritten notes by Himmler, are among the best evidence that exists to rebut claims that the Holocaust is a myth, archivists say.  \"The notes give them their authenticity,\" said Robert Wolfe, a supervisory archivist for captured German records.  \"He was supposed to destroy them.  Like a lot of bosses, he didn\\'t obey his own rules.\"  The documents, moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hoped would be a safe hiding place, were recovered by Allied forces after World War II from a salt mine near Salzburg, Austria.  Himmler spoke on Oct.4, 1943, in Posen, Poland, to more than 100 German secret police generals.  \"I also want to talk to you, quite frankly, on a very grave matter.  Among ourselves it should be mentioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly. I mean the clearing out of the Jew, the extermination of the Jewish race.  This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never been written and is never to be written.\"  [Emphasis mine--rje]  The German word Himmler uses that is translated as \"extermination\" is *Ausrottung*.  Wolfe said a more precise translation would be \"extirpation\" or \"tearing up by the roots.\"  In his handwritten notes, Himmler used a euphemism, \"Judenevakuierung\" or \"evacuation of the Jews.\"  But archives officials said \"extermination\" is the word he actually spoke--preserved on an audiotape in the archives.  Himmler, who oversaw Adolf Hitler\\'s \"final solution of the Jewish question,\" committed suicide after he was arrested in 1945.  The National Archives exhibit, on display through May 16, is a preview of the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum here on April 26.  The National Archives exhibit includes a page each of Himmler\\'s handwritten notes, a typed transcript from the speech and an offical translation made for the Nuremberg war crimes trials.   ---From p.A10 of Saturday\\'s L.A.

But you\\'ve picked the wrong topic if you think a few rigged \"quotations\" can sustain the legend and lie of the Deir Yassin \"massacre.\"  You have a lot to learn when it comes to historical methodology. At the most basic level, you should know that there is a big difference between weighing evidence fairly and merely finding \"quotations\" that support your preset opinions.  If you have studied the history of Israel at all you must know that many of the sources of your \"quotations\" have an axe to grind, and therefore you must be very careful about whom you \"quote.\"  For example, Meir Pa\\'il, whom you cite, was indeed a general, a scholar, and a war hero.  But that doesn\\'t mean everything that comes out of his mouth is gold.  In fact (and here your lack of experience shows), Pa\\'il is such a fanatic, embittered leftist that much of his anti-Israel blathering (forget about anti-Irgun blathering) would be considered something like treason in non-Israel contexts.  But of course you don\\'t consider this AT ALL when you find a juicy \"quotation\" that you can use to attack Israel.  Benny Morris (of Hashomer Hatzair) represents himself as a \"scholar\" when he rehashes the old attacks on the Irgun.  Don\\'t be fooled. It\\'s just the old Zionist ideological catfight, surfacing as an attack on the (then-) Likud government.  If you will look closely at the section on Deir Yassin in his book on the War of Independence, you will see his \"indictment\" to be pure hot air.  And this is the BEST HE CAN DO after decades of digging for any sort of damning evidence.  Unfortunately for him, because his book parades itself as \"scholarly,\" he is forced to put footnotes.  So you can clearly see that his Deir Yassin account is based on nothing.  The Deir Yassin \"massacre\" never took place as the propagandists tell it, any more than the Sabra and Shatila \"massacres.\" Do you get the feeling people like to blame the Jews for \"massacres,\" even if they have to make them up?  It must sound spicy.  Even some Jews like to do it, for reasons of their own.  Please, don\\'t confuse any of you Deir Yassin \"massacre\" stuff with facts or scholarship.

Andy Byler  [You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Church establishing or changing a law.  The argument against the Sabbath is that it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of the ceremonial law is not binding on Christians.  This argument is based on Paul\\'s letters, Acts, and in a more general sense, Jesus\\' teachings.  Further, most people argue that Scripture shows worship occuring on Sunday, and Paul endorsing it.  I understand that these points are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one more time.  The point I\\'m making here is not that these arguments are right, but that the backing they claim is Scripture.  Accepting the principle of \"sola scriptura\" does not commit us to obeying the entire Jewish Law.  Acts 15 and Paul\\'s letters are quite clear on that.  I think even the SDA\\'s accept it.  The disagreement is on where the Bible would have us place the line.  By the way, Protestants do give authority to the church, in matters that are not dictated by God.  That\\'s why churches are free to determine their own liturgies, church polity, etc.  If you accept that the Sabbath is not binding on Christians, then the day of worship falls into the category of items on which individual Christians or (since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free to decide.',\n",

Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by  performing studies that are \"blind\" in various ways.  Some of these are:    o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a       placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether they are in the      control group or the test group.    o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects       receive a placebo or the test treatment.    o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects      receive a placebo or the test treatment.

It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are animals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results because those who performed the study did not \"blind\" themselves.

The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because    they teach doctrines contrary to the (uncontroverted)    parts of the canon.     then I answer:     These is a logically invalid *a priori*.     Besides, we are talking about OT texts-     which in many parts are superceded by the NT    (in the Xtian view). Would not this same    principle exclude _Ecclesiastes_?    This principle cannot be consistently applied.   I have to reject your argument here.  The Spirit speaks with one voice, and he does not contradict himself.    The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired by the Spirit, i.e., God-breathed.  It is a test which is more guided by faith than by reason or logic.  The early church decided that the Apocrypha did not meet this test--even though some books such as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses.  For example, the Lutheran hymn \"Now Thank We All Our God\" quotes a passage from this book.  The deutero-canonical books were added much later in the church\\'s history.  They do not have the same spiritual quality as the rest of Scripture.  I do not believe the church that added these books was guided by the Spirit in so doing.

       "  ' The \"so sacred it\\'s secret\" explanation is a bit misleading.  While there is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no injunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But since public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather keep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.  But there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the ceremony itself.   There are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter. One must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was written by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret information to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve (Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).  Irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and bishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He claims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the apostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which we today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius, op. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a* gnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.  Writings dealing with Jesus\\' post-resurrection teachings emphasize secrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching certain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a dialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter\\'s response is \"You seem to me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you both whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not permitted to me now to disclose these things to you\" (_Clementine Recognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_ it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but can be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.  Now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I don\\'t intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I believe that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of early Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.   But if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect to read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of Mormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on temple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in temples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that worship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all* practices which might have taken place, and that absence of such descriptions proves they did not exist?  Mormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from which I have taken a few:  1. \"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given\" (Matt. 13:11).  2. \"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given\" (Matt. 19:11).  3. \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now\" (John 16:12).  4. \"The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father\" (John 16:25).  5. \"... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\" (1 Cor. 3:1-2).  6. \"Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ... come unto you and speak face to face\" (2 Jn. 1:12).  (Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)  Again, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe they serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught were actually taught openly.   Historically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple endowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons. There is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not change after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had ample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his time and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific connection has yet been established.  My conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite transcriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe that the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As our moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the recent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who charge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have adequate knowledge of the rites in question. --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------          Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City                     jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu',\n",

       "  '     I think that you are incorrect, Roger.  Patrick, Smythe and Adams all played or coached in the league before becoming front office types.  Hence, they did help build the league, although they were not great players themselves.     I agree that a name is a name is a name, and if some people have trouble with names that are not easily processed by the fans, then changing them to names that are more easily processed seems like a reasonable idea.  If we can get people in the (arena) door by being uncomplicated, then let\\'s do so.  Once we have them, they will realize what a great game hockey is, and we can then teach them something abotu the history of the game.       No, I would not want to see a Ballard division.  But to say that these owners are assholes, hence all NHL management people are assholes would be fallacious.  Conn Smythe, for example, was a classy individual (from what I have heard).    Also, isn\\'t the point of \"professional\" hockey to make money for all those involved, which would include the players.  What I think you might be saying is that the players have not made as much money as should have been their due, and it is the players that are what make the game great not the people who put them on the ice, so naming division after management people rather than players is adding insult (in the form of lesser recognition) to injury (less money than was deserved).

(Note, this #>is *any* belief, not belief in Gods) #> #  #Tiring to say the least. I have backed it up, read the first statement.  I have read it.  Conspicuous by its absence is any evidence or point.  #  #The latter is the fallacy of the wrong analogy. Saying someone believes #something is hardly an information about the person at all. Saying someone #is a theist holds much more information. Further, the correlation between #theists and fanatism is higher than that between belief at all and fanatism #because of the special features of theistic belief.  Truth by blatant assertion.  Evidence? #  #  #>#>Gullibility, #>#>blind obedience to authority, lack of scepticism, and so on, are all more #>#>reliable indicators.  And the really dangerous people - the sources of #>#>fanaticism - are often none of these things.  They are cynical manipulators #>#>of the gullible, who know precisely what they are doing. #># #>#That\\'s a claim you have to support. Please note that especially in the #>#field of theism, the leaders believe what they say. #> #>If you believe that, you\\'re incredibly naive. #> #  #You, Frank O\\'Dwyer, are living in a dream world. I wonder if there is any #base of discussion left after such a statement. As a matter of fact, I think #you are ignorant of human nature. Even when one starts with something one does #not believe, one gets easily fooled into actually believing what one says. #  #To give you the benefit of the doubt, prove your statement.  The onus of proof is on you, sunshine.  What makes you think that theist leaders believe what they say?  Especially when they say one thing and do another, or say one thing closely followed by its opposite?  The practice is not restricted to theism, but it\\'s there for anyone to see.  It\\'s almost an epidemic in this country.  Just for instance, if it is harder for a camel to pass thru\\' the eye of a needle, why is the Catholic church such a wealthy land-owner?  Why are there churches to the square inch in my country? #  #>#>Now, *some* #>#>brands of theism, and more precisely *some* theists, do tend to fanaticism, #>#>I grant you.

Ever read Animal Farm? #>#> #>#That\\'s a straw man. And as usually in discussions with you one has to #>#repeat it: Read what I have written above: not every theism leads to #>#fanatism, and not all fanatism is caused by theism. The point is, #>#there is a correlation, and it comes from innate features of theism. #> #>No, some of it comes from features which *some* theism has in common #>with *some* fanaticism.

The word you\\'re groping for is \"some\". #> #  #Bogus again. Not all theism as is is fanatic. However, the rest already #gives backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and #theism. And further, the specialty of other theistic beliefs allows them #to switch to fanatism easily. It takes just a nifty improvement in the #theology.  Truth by blatant assertion.   #  #  #>#Gullibility, by the way, is one of them. #> #>No shit, Sherlock.  So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism, #>since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have, as opposed #>to the case you are trying to make? #> #  #Because there is more about theism that the attraction to gullible people #causing the correlation. And the whole discussion started that way by the #statement that theism is meaningfully correlated to fanatism, which you #challenged.  Indeed I did.  As I recall, I asked for evidence.  What is the correlation of which you speak?   #  #  #>#And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw #>#men.

I am quite well aware that giving everyone their rights #protects me better from fanatics than the other way round.  Of course, other people are always fanatics, never oneself.  Your wish to slur all theists seems pretty fanatical to me. #  #It is quite nice to see that you are actually implying a connection between #that argument and the rise of fanatism.

       "  \"There is a cartridge capping upgrade for older deskjet printers available from hewlett-packard.  Older original deskjet and possibly deskjet 500 units may have a black plastic slide with rubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right side (viewed from front) of the printer.  Newer printers have a gray or white plastic slide.  The black plastic slide can allow your cartridge to dry out.  There was and may still be information packaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation.  HP placed a coupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new capping mechanism.  I did this on my printer and did indeed find that the cartidges now last longer.  I don't have the information handy.  I suggest contacting your nearest HP service center for information on obtaining the kit.  HP has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical components that vary depending on the starting level printer and the level to which you wish to upgrade.  I upgraded my original desket to a dekjet 500.  The kit was fairly expensive.  You are likely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new deskjet 500 now that prices have declined so much.  Upgrading an original deskjet to 500 requires a fair amount of skill, but no soldering.  Upgrading a deskjet plus to a 500 is involves swapping the processor card and changing a few minor parts.  Contact your HP service center for further information.  The PCL language used by Deskjets is considerably different from the PCL used by laser printers, especially the newer laser printers.  The biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a raster end command after each scan line.  This makes no material difference for lasers, but causes the deskjet to print the accumulated raster.  As you might guess, the result is hideously slow printing.  The new DOS Wordperfect print deskjet drivers are still guilty of this particular behavior.  From the way Wordperfect works, this would not be easy to change.  Windows Wordperfect works efficiently unless you use the DOS drivers instead of Windows'.  The PCL4 dialect used in the Laserjet IIIP allows compression that permits a full page 300 dpi image to be rendered with only one megabyte of memory.  An uncompressed image could be as large as about 909 Kbytes, but the printer needs about 300K of memory for its internal house-keeping.  Laserjet IV models support banded printing that allows incrmental download of the image with compression in limited memory situations.  Deskjet downloadable fonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts.  A single page from a laserjet only requires about 20 seconds.  This is faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet printer.  The presumption, of course, being that the laser printer has completed its warm-up cyle.  Until ink chemistry is changed, wicking resulting in image deterioration is unavoidable.  I won't use the word impossible, but matching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely. Chosing an appropriate paper type helps, but does not eliminate the problem.  Laser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable components.  HP does accept return of spent toner cartridges, mitigating the material waste problem to a degree.  Energy waste could use more work.  Warm-up times have decreased, allowing stand-by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the laserjet IV.  Kyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous silicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system.  The image drum is good for approximately 100K copies.  It is a very nice print engine.  I wish HP used the Kyocera engine.  Kyocera also has a neat modular paper source and stacker system.  The recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower than any of HP's laser printers.  The pick-up pressure rollers are subject to wear and I case confirm eventually do wear out.  The usual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper. The paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a single part from HP service.  Replacement cost for the transport is almost $200.  The feed rollers are not separately replacable, though it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician. I have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer.  It depends upon the application which printer is best for you.  If you only print 5 or 10 pages a day and are satisfied with the appearance of output, the deskjet is a very good choice.  As noted, the deskjet 500 is my choice for personal use.  \",\n",

And our argument is that you cannot remove them from the people who need restricting and not remove them from the people who don\\'t.  A fairly simple problem, given our size and numbers.  Do you agree?  We all believe criminals, particularly violent criminals, should not have firearms.  The problem is making a law that does this without trodding upon the rights of the vast majority.  Nobody here seems to be able to do it, and I doubt anybody in Norway can either.  Thus, we are left with a philosophical difference: does the safety of a few justify restricting the many?  We say \"no,\" while others say \"yes.\"    Can you provide a method that cannot be abused?  I doubt it.    Of course.  This is not in contention.  What is in contention is how much one has to pay.    It is this \"giving a little\" that makes Americans wary... We have seen this argument before.  You might remember how a Chamberlain \"gave a little\" to a particular fascist/short asshole, and how such \"appeasement\" worked.  While it might work in some instances, it doesn\\'t work in others, and since we cannot predict the future we must be cautious in using actions that have a history of failure.    Cars are not essential in Norway any more than they are in the USA.  I\\'m willing to bet that you have neighbors that would be willing to drive you anywhere you wanted to go for a price.  Thus, cars are not essential for your transportation.  However, the arguments presented show that, since cars are used to kill far more people than guns in the USA, it makes much more sense to restrict cars than it does guns.  How one defines \"essential\" often depends upon what one is willing to go through for that service.  When we look at the raw data, such comparisons are not individually weighed.    This depends upon what the populace was willing to do.  As Desert Storm proved, even an armed populace won\\'t just revolt even when given a chance.  Still, would Hitler have done all that he did with an armed populace?  We have to wonder, as some of his first acts were to confiscate firearms.  Other points in history show that dictators were overthrown by arms in the hands of the populace. Thus, we\\'re left wondering if Hitler would have been overthrown or if King George was just unlucky in keeping the USA as a colony. One can argue both sides; one also has to live with each action.    It is about #2, but so far all proposals to curtail #2 have wound up enforcing #1 as well.  I only wish that \"or\" was so logical.    That was, on my part, purely in jest.  I merely pointed out how we were from similar backgrounds racially, but of wholly different backgrounds politically.  I thought this would underscore my point on how our cultures were so different despite similar heritage.    BATF can *only* enforce gun/tobaccco/alcohol violations.

Being brought up in a Christian household, I often wondered if there was God the Father, where was the mother? Everyone I know who has a father usually as a mother. It just seemed rather unbalanced to me.   Fortunately, my own personal theology, which will probably not fall into line with a lot others, recognized God as a being both without gender and posessing qualities of both genders, as being both a masculine and feminine force. It provides a sense of balance I find sorely lacking in most theologies, a lack which I think is responsible for a lot of the unbalanced ways in which we see the world and treat each other.',\n",

       "  'Why should anyone (check: let\\'s restrict this to Christians, why do *we*) want to find \"commandments\" in the books regarded as scripture?  What\\'s going on? I will pass on psychologizing answers (whether dismissive or more open) as not the kind of issue to deal with here -- the question is what is the *theological* point involved?  And it has been quoted \"at\" me often enough by those who don\\'t believe I take it seriously, that Jesus (is said to have) said, \"If you love me, you will obey my commands.\"  [John 14:15]  I am, like any Christian, the slave of Christ, and it is my will that I should do as He wills me to do.  I am (also, or instead) His younger brother, but still under His direction, though we both call God \"Abba.\"  Christians, therefore, will try to find what it is that their Lord commands them, and discovering it will feel obligated to do it, or to confess their failure. Readers here may set aside the theologizing jargon (such as \"slaves of Christ\") -- the point is that adherents of a religion *will* read the texts (whether classified as \"inspired\" or not) that are held up as models, in an effort to find application to their own situations.  This practice ranges from \"devotional\" reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon- ical scripture as \"the Word of God.\"  And at the highest pitch, this leads to a question of whether we *can* find in inspired scripture something that can act as \"absolute\" guidance for our actions.  The problem is in finding out just *what* it is our Lord commands.  I am going to set aside for this essay one major direction in which Christians have looked for these commands, namely Christian tradition.  That is not because *I* reject tradition, but because my primary audience in this essay is Protestants, who deny tradition a determinative value, in favor of the witness of Scripture.  The question I want to deal with is, WHAT commandments can we find from our Lord in Scripture?  And that turns out to be a hard question.  [ If any of my Protestant Inquisitors would *like* to turn the discussion to the authority of tradition, I can accomodate them :-), unlike *most* Protestants, Episcopalians admit claims from a) Scripture b) Reason and c) Tradition on roughly equal standing. ]  Earlier in John than my quote above, we read [John 13:34] \"I give you a new  commandment: love one another.\"  This is the ONLY place in the NT where Christians are given an explicit commandment, with the context commenting on its imperative mode pronouncement by Jesus.  At the same meal [so we *readers* infer, since it is *not* in John, but in the Synoptics] Jesus says, \"Take this [bread]; this is my body.\"  [Mark 14:22, cf. Matthew 26:26, Luke 22:19, 1 Corinthians 11:24]  The mode is imperative (Greek _labete_), and hence this, too, is a \"commandment.\"  In *both* cases we have to *infer* that the command is directed to a wider circle than the immediate collocation of disciples -- because we judge the evangelist\\'s point in mentioning it (with the disciples by then mostly or entirely dead) is that *we* are expected to follow this as a commandment from our Lord.  In the case of communion, Paul\\'s mention (at least; this is probably true of the evangelists also) implies an ongoing ritual liturgy in which these words operate to \"bind\" Christians to the original command to his disciples, as a continuing commandment to the Christian community.  I am entirely comfortable with this inference, but I *must* point out that it is THERE, between us and the occasion on which Jesus spoke the command. I take it as a clear inference, at the very least the EVANGELIST\\'S notion, that *all* Christians are called to love one another, in Jesus\\' command directed at the disciples.  But I have to call attention to the inference. The command CANNOT apply to me without the generalization from the specific context of its statement to my own context as a \"disciple\" of Christ.  All reading of scripture has to make such inferences, to get any sense out of the text whatsoever.  This is a general problem in reading these texts -- we cannot read them at all without our *own* understanding of our native languages in which we (normally) read the (translated) texts, and without *some* appreciation of the original context (and at points, the original languages, when English misleads us.) I am going to presume, in what follows, that we have the *general* problem of how to read scripture under control [ I don\\'t *really* think this is true, but it will suffice for my current purposes. ]  I will address ONLY the issues that arise when we have already coped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world than the one we live in.  Questions at THAT level only introduce MORE reser- vations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we can read the texts as the original audience might have done.  Among the reasons we have for seeing John\\'s _agapate allelou_ as a *general* commandment (not merely an instruction by Jesus to this disciples on that one occasion), and one linking it to the Synoptic \"Great Commandment\" is that we have criticism, from Jesus, about limiting our love to those whom we congenially associate with.  In Matthew 5:43ff we read, \"You have learnt say to you: love your enemies.\"  In fact, the Leviticus context quoted does NOT say \\'hate your enemy\\' -- it is merely the common human presumption. (And Leviticus is at pains to say that the \"love\" should extend to strangers amongst the people of Israel.)  Luke, in expanding on this same Q context, goes on to have Jesus say. \"Even sinners love those who love them.\" [6:27] All of this suggests [quite strongly, I\\'d say :-)] that *limiting* the scope of the \"new commandment\" is not quite what Jesus has in mind.  In short, inference *leads me* to generalizing the actual text to a command that is \"in force\" on Christians, and with objects not limited to other Christians.  Trickier than the _agapate allelou_ or Institution of communion, there is the case of the \"Great Commission\" where (Matthew 10, Mark 6) the Twelve are sent out to evangelize, \"Proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand.\"  The verb is imperative (_ke:russete_), but the context is rather specific to the Twelve, and there are further specifiers (as in \"Do not turn your steps to pagan territory, and do not enter any Samaritan town\" -- the Lukan parallels are even more specific to Jesus\\' final journey to Jerusalem) which make it harder to see this generalizing to all Christians than the previous examples.  That hasn\\'t prevented Christians from MAKING such an inference; what I have to call attention to is that such inference is NOT justified in the text, nor (unlike the first two cases I cite) by the rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader.  Still, Paul seems to have felt obliged to \"proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand\" even (contrary to Jesus\\' instructions to the 12 :-)) to the gentiles, to the ends of the earth.  So, Christians after him have also taken this as a \"commandment\" in the sense of John 14:15.  Do I \"accept\" this?  I don\\'t know.  It is surely rather speculative.  But you see how the ripples of inference spread out from the text that is the pretext -- Christians (may) infer a general commandment, applicable to all, from what is presented in the gospels as a specific occasion.  I do not (necessarily) object to this kind of generalization -- but I *insist* that people who make it *must* have an understanding that they are *reasoning* (at some considerable length) from what we actually *have* in scripture.  There are *assumptions* involved in this reasoning, and *these* are *not* themselves scriptural (though people will do their best to \"justify\" their assumptions by OTHER references to scripture -- which simply adds MORE inference into the mix!)  Let\\'s move on to the \"Great Commandment\" -- that we should love God with our whole hearts and minds and souls.  This is, perhaps, the Synoptic \"equivalent\" of John\\'s _agapate allelou_.  And yet,  it is not PRESENTED as a commandment, in our texts.  Rather, the context is controversy with the Pharisees.  To cite Matthew [22:34ff]   \"But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees  they got together and, to disconcert him, one of them put a question,  \"Master, which is the greatest commandment of the Law?\"  It is by no means obvious here (though I accept it as such) that Jesus\\' answer is meant to be a commandment *to Christians*.  He is answering a polemic from his enemies.  [ Mark\\'s account, in  12:28-34 casts the answer in a far more positive light as (so the \"scribe\" in this version says) \"far more important than any holocaust (I need to point out that this word originates in the context of animal sacrifice; forget the Nazis for this) or sacrifice.\"  Luke is intermediate -- he has a lawyer posing the question \"to disconcert\" Jesus, and gets the Good Samarian parable for his pains [ Luke 10:25-37 ].  The contexts here are so confusingly various that one could be forgiven for drawing *no* inferences :-)  In *no* account is this said as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on Christians -- though I think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each case that Jesus thinks it to be so.  The point is that our mental gears HAVE to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about what WE are commanded to do, by Jesus.  And all of this is contingent on our understanding the point of Jesus\\' use of the Torah in the (all quite different) gospel accounts, and the application of such a context to *us*.  The different contexts among the Synoptics are curious.  It should be noted that ONLY in Luke do we get the \"fixing\" of this command by the parable of the Good Samaritan.  We may look for an analogous *intent* in Matthew, where 7:12 gives the \"Golden Rule\" as \"the meaning of the Law and the Prophets\" (and where we may also hear an echo of Hillel saying the same, a generation before Jesus.)  If we make these associations (which I think are entirely reasonable), we are -- again -- indulging in inference.  The texts do not *explicitly* support us; rather, we *read* the texts as having this kind of inter-relationship.  Current literary theory calls this \"intertextuality.\"  My discussion of why the _agapate allelou_ \"has\" to apply beyond the  community of the disciples, and beyound the circle of Christian believers, applies again here, to buttress a conclusion that this *is* (despite the presentation not saying so explicitly) a \"commandment\" to Christians. Few Christians would disagree with my conclusions -- but I *must* point out that they *are* conclusions, they *depend* on rather elaborate chains of reasoning that are simply NOT present in the texts, themselves.  The contextual problem keeps coming up, more and more severely as we look at those sayings of Jesus that are NOT so universally taken by Christians as  commandments.  And we get some really hard cases.  Take divorce.  Mark is  pretty clear, \"The man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty of adultery against her.\"  [ 10:11, cf. Luke 16:18 ] -- except that Matthew has an escape clause [ \"except in the case of fornication\", 5:31 ]. This seems to be a rather clear \"commandment\" (whether or not we take Matthew\\'s reservation); and some Christians, to this day, take it so.  But some don\\'t, at least in practice.  This is rather peculiar; it is not as if Jesus were not explicit about this (whereas He says nothing at all about some of the things people gnash their teeth over.)  How is it possible, if the commands of Christ are clear, that Matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists of the synoptic tradition?  I\\'m going to continue this examination, into ever-murkier waters, but this is enough to start with.  The theme is: \"finding commandments in scripture is an exercise in inference; our inferences are informed by OUR assumptions, that is, our own cultural biases.\"  I have, so far, identified a very few \"commandments\" that are generally accepted by all Christians -- and yet in these, already, some of the difficulties start to surface.  It is these difficulties I want to discuss in my next essay on this topic.  The divorce commandment already strikes at some of the difficulties: I see almost no evidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn *me* with, spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soc.couples or misc.legal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce, or demanding that US law refuse to allow it, or refuse \"unrepentant divorcees\" places in their churches.  [ That is not to say that divorce *doesn\\'t* enter into  consideration in general -- it is most definitely a matter of concern, in even the most \"liberal\" church circles.  For example, a (wildly) liberal Episcopalian priest of my aqauintence, in a (wildly) liberal diocese, has recommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a \"private\" secular ceremony before a judge, so that the \"public\" ceremony he celebrated need not go through an agonizing \"examination\" by officials who would just as soon NOT take on this role of interpreting the commands we are faced with as Christians.  This, in a church that was effectively CREATED by a famous divorce! ]',\n",

       "  '  If I get a chance I will ask them this weekend.                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  The words I have underlined are at the heart of the problem. A \"quick look\" doesn\\'t do justice to the depth of the book of Jeremiah. Having studied the Jeremiah/Ezekial period solidly for over a year at one stage of my life, I have to say that there is a great deal of underlying theological meaning in the judgement prophesies. Let me make one point. The clash between Jeremiah and the \"false prophets\" was primarily in the theological realm. The \"false prophets\" understood their relatioship to God to be based on the covenant that the Lord made with David. It is possible to trace within the pages of the Old Testament who this covenant, which was initially conditional on the continued obedience of David\\'s descendants, came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part of the Lord to keep a descendant of David\\'s upon the throne and to never allow Jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power. Jeremiah was not a Judahite prophet. He was from Anathoth, across the border in what had formerly been Israelite territory. When he came to prophesy, he came from the theological background of the covenant the Lord had made with Israel through Moses. The northern Kingdom had rejected the Davidic covenant after the death of Solomon. His theology clashed with the theology of the local prophets. It was out of a very deep understanding of the Mosaic covenant and an actute awareness of international events that Jeremiah spoke his prophesies.

       "  ' Rutin is a bioflavonoid, compounds found (among other places) in the rinds of citrus fruits.  These have been popular, especially in Europe, to treat \"capillary fragility\", and seemingly in even more extreme cases-- a few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he\\'d had hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously, I asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active ingredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical sputtering.  I have no idea how he\\'s doing hemorrhoid-wise these days. The studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in human disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the reports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.  This stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so there\\'s little risk of trying it, but I wouldn\\'t expect much of a result. ',\n",

I suppose it\\'s  possible to determine how a chip has been programmed with a  sophisticated[sp?] x-ray machine to look for blown fuses.)   The U\\'s are programmed independantly by the escrow agencies.  Notes:  For tapping escrow agency Y is given N[0], E(K0[Y], U0[Y]), N[1],  E(K1[Y], U1[Y]) and returns K0[Y], K1[Y].   LEA\\'s must contact all escrow agencies with the serial numbers from  both chips and the encrypted partial keys. This allows the agencies  to record that both chips were tapped.   LEA\\'s only get the session key, not the key to all conversations  of a particular chip. This precludes real-time decrypting of a  conversation but that isn\\'t one of the STATED requirements.  Observation:  In order for any secure by \"tap-able\" communication scheme to work,  the active parts need to share a secret. And if this secret is  revealed, communications by those that know the secret can be made  \"un-tap-able\". Obvious candidates are the cryptographic algorithm  and the master (family) key. Relative size and complexity suggests  that the key can be obtained from a silicon implementation of the  scheme a LOT easier and faster than the algorithm.         rsbx  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Raymond S.

       "  'OK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime, the effects of scaling and so on, I thought I\\'d do some more tests.  First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor). I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results (for better or for worse).  I pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\\'s a sequence where the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized a portion of about 30 seconds\\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only 5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.  I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor, keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default \"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten frames.  I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used for the results I\\'d been reporting earlier.  Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.  That\\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.  I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240 size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in action, not 1.5. I\\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\\'t think it\\'s entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...  Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.  The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with \"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\\'s normal synchronized playback). A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\\'t work too well: the playback was very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with ease. I can\\'t believe that QuickTime\\'s synchronization code would add this much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\\'s task switching.  A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\\'t see any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.  I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance even more...',\n",

       "  '  Point 1:  I\\'m beginning to see that *part* of the disagreements about the whole \"yeast issue\" is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings of words.  Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized \"jargon\", necessary for precise communication within their field (which I\\'m fully cognizant of since I, too, speak \"jargonese\" when with my peers).  For the situation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors can have a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the world at large, causing significant miscommunication.  One example word, and very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of \"systemic\". It is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, much more so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  There is also the observation of this newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially equal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fan the flames.  This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get really \"beat up\" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which they otherwise don\\'t see much of in their practice except for the occasional \"difficult\" patient.  Point 2:  I understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not prescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments have been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed clinical trials (usually double-blind), or that such treatments/therapies are part of an approved and funded clinical trial.  To these doctors, to do any differently would, in this belief system, be unethical practice.  And it follows that any therapy not on the \"accepted\" list is therefore a non- therapy - it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis or theory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation of what is currently known.  Anecdotal evidence has no value, either, from a treatment point-of-view.  And by and large, as a scientist myself, I am glad that medical practice/ science takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment.  However, as also being a human being (last I checked), and having been one of those people that has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, where \"standard\" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back and wonder if holding such an extreme and rigid \"scientific\" viewpoint is in itself unethical from humanitarian considerations.  After all, the underlying intent of the \"scientific\" approach to medicine is to protect the health of the patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so the patient should come first when considering treatment.  What we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both the \"scientific\" and the \"humanitarian\" viewpoints.  In an earlier post I outlined a crazy idea for doing just that.  The gist of it was to give any physician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe alternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence) for patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted (and not until then).  The patient would be fully informed that such therapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that there are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived from them.  This approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor.  It also satisfies the humanitarian needs of the patient.  And the reality is that many patients who have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted medicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community:  either to the doctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing their license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical training.  This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control more within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleaned could help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most productive way.  Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - I\\'m sure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented more as a strawman to stimulate discussion.  Hopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to why I am \"open\" to alternative therapies, as well as why I have real difficulty (read \"apparent hostility\") with the \"coldness\" of the 99.9% pure \"scientific\" approach to medicine.  I believe the best approach to medical treatment is one where both the \"humanitarian\" aspects are balanced with and by the \"scientific\" aspects.  Anything else is just not good medicine, imho.

The question is whether : anyone is going to be doing large-scale satellite servicing in the near : future, to the point of justifying development of such a thing.  That\\'s a mighty fine idea.  But since you asked \"Why not,\" I\\'ll respond.  Putting aside the application of such a space dock, there are other factors to consider than just pressurized volume.  Temperature control is difficult in space, and your inflatable hangar will have to  incorporate thermal insulation (maybe a double-walled inflatable). Micrometeoroid protection and radiation protection are also required. Don\\'t think this will be a clear plastic bubble; it\\'s more likely to look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multi-layer fabric that soft-torso space suits are made out of today.  Because almost all manned space vessels (Skylab, Mir, Salyut) used their pressurization for increased structural rigidity, even though they had (have) metal skins, they still kind of qualify as inflatable.  The inflation process would have to be carefully controlled.  The space environment reduces ductility in exposed materials (due to temperature extremes, monotomic Oxygen impingement, and radiation effects on materials), so your \"fabric\" may not retain any flexibility for long.  (This may not matter.)  Even after inflation, pressure changes in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric, which could lead to holes and tears as ductility decreases.  These are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposal for an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of success.  -- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office       kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368',\n",

       "  '[ Lots of stuff deleted because I felt like it ]  This MS bashing has definitely lost all its humor value.  I think most of the people posting are forgetting that most users of MS products do not even know about internet, and Unix is that very unfriendly place where bizzare abreviations replace the rather comfortable abreviations they know. And the abreviations have subtle differences between the different vendors. While PC users tend to customize any windowing setup, they can not do much with their  command line.  So to most of the computer users in the world MS product symbolize quality. MS has made their life easier, and more productive and to them that is quality. They do not care about what innovative things MS has done, other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a lot easier. You may know better than most computer users in this world but that will not change their perception.

Maybe clh may wish to provide the first response.  There is a lot of talk about the Sabbath of the TC being ceremonial.  Answer this:  Since the TC commandments is one law with ten parts on what biblical basis have you decided that only the Sabbath portion is ceremonial? OR You say that the seventh-day is the Sabbath but not applicable to Gentile Christians.  Does that mean the Sabbath commandment has been annulled?  References please.

Participants who complete the program can earn two semester hours of graduate credit from Aurora College. Please note that while the class is intended for teachers, it is not restricted to teachers.  The class, which is being cosponsored by the United States Space Foundation, will teach how to use space exploration as a teaching tool to get students excited about learning and interested in science.  Classroom topics to be covered by the class include:      > Living in Space      > The Space Shuttle      > The Space Station      > NASA Spinoffs that Benefit Society      > Principles of Astrodynamics/Aeronautics      > The Solar System  There will also be simulated Zero-G training in an underwater space station simulation, model rocket launches, observing sessions at the Harper College Observatory, and field trips to the Adler Planetarium and the Museum of Science and Industry.  Featured speakers include Jerry Brown of the Colorado based United States Space Foundation and Debbie Brown of the NASA Lewis Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Additional instructors will be provided by the Planetary Studies Foundation.  The social highlight of the class will be a dinner banquet featuring Space Shuttle Payload Specialist Byron Lichtenberg, currently President of Payload Systems, Inc. Lichtenberg was a member of the crew of STS-9 which flew in November 1983. The banquet is scheduled for Thursday, June 17.  The registration fee includes transportation for field trips, materials, continental breakfasts, lunches, and the special dinner banquet. Guest tickets for the dinner banquet are also available.  There is an additional charge to receive the two hours of graduate credit. For any additional information about the class, contact the Science Learning Center at (708) 359-7913.

       "  \" I was at an interesting seminar at work (UK's R.A.L. Space Science Dept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail proposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to generate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out at the meeting. Here goes :      The Microlight Solar Sail    -------------------------  1. Introduction The solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of sunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a vehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.  However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most people realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per square kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized fabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type spacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte idea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.  2.Design Recent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a tiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely be electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control methods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a panel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.  The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at Edinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data gathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and communication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface of the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.  3.Missions The craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example: a) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor groups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit rate. b) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved areas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to reflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive sunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these locations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar base, BTW] c) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet nucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged tube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an ideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat is reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300 deg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating container.

       "  ' I have a question that is a slight variation on the previously mentioned examples that perhaps people could give me some pointers on (it has been a couple of years since my Con Law class in college so I hope I am not missing something obvious here...)  Basic Scenario:   I set up a bbs that uses public-key encryption and encryption of  files on disk.  The general setup is designed so that when users   connect they send a private key encrypted using the system public  key and the user\\'s public-private keypair is used to wrap the  one-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  The  result of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it  is impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the  machine.  What is possible is for someone to use the revealed  system private key to entice users into revealing thier personal  private keys during the authentication sequence.  Questions:   Does the fact that the system private key does not provide any  information useful for a search give me any protection as far as  being coerced to reveal the key?  (I doubt it myself..)   It seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am  assisting in \"entrapment\" (the users would send thier key anyway  and are not being enticed into doing something they would not  otherwise do) but is there any other hook that can be used?   Would the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval?  Any answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated...  jim',\n",

       "  \"Was going over some videos last night.....  Studying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very interesting.  And enlightening.  Here's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco, circa June 1986.  1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,     not gain more bulk.  2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's     lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.  3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like     Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is     released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -     Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his     stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,     they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard     to make adjustments in your swing.  What would I do, if I were Jose?  Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch, so that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.  First, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance, and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this will cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move the bathead more freely.  Second, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.  Third, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find my 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling the wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength  is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of the park.  If Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back problems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could still hit 600+ HR.  \",\n",

       "  \" When will people learn!  The trouble is the ballast in the concrete and as every fool knows Ballast  resistors are used to discharge batteries. Furthermore it is very silly to  store the battery with the terminals downwards as you must have done to  contact the ballast.   Seriously: self discharge (the actual problem, as stated by others) does vary  greatly with certain types and freaks show low self discharge. I have in  fact seen ordinary automotive batteries which have effectively held full  charge for > 2 years so it must be possible.  If your garage is heated, store the batteries somewhere cooler but above  freezing (flat batteries freeze more easily). Occasionally charge it (once a  month?) or even leave it on 'float' charge permanently (special charger,  DON'T do this unless you know what you are doing, seriously dangerous).  Anouther point is the unsuitability of automotive batteries for things like  electric mowers -- they are not generally designed to be repeatedly deep  discharged and their life may be greatly shorted. Some early zero maintenance  automotive batteries in fact responded to a full discharge with total failure  shortly afterwards but modern ones are superb. (6yrs, 95000 miles and  counting)\",\n",

       "  '------- Blind-Carbon-Copy  To: spacenews@austen.rand.org, cti@austen.rand.org Subject: White House outlines options for station, Russian cooperation Date: Tue, 06 Apr 93 16:00:21 PDT From: Richard Buenneke <buenneke@austen.rand.org>  4/06/93:  GIBBONS OUTLINES SPACE STATION REDESIGN GUIDANCE  NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C. April 6, 1993  RELEASE:  93-64          Dr.  John H.  Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station.          A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development, operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.          Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the President\\'s new technology investment.  As a result, station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.          Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider.          Gibbons also announced that the United States and its international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give \"full consideration\" to use of Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.          To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes. Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal.          Gibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\"          NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian participation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science Center at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.',\n",

Let's assume he made that in 1928 (I'm not sure of the figures, but I know I'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)  Today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.  FV = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928)    = $80,000 x (1.04)^65    = just over $1,000,000.  Assuming inflation is average of around 5%.  FV = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65    = almost 2,000,000.  (I didn't crunch these numbers beforehand).  These numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly  overpaid.  The Babe appears to have made then what today's average to above average players make now.  Perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and  average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but I don`t  think I'm off by much.  Chop Chop  Michael Mule'    \",\n",

No scientist would take your statement --- \"no convincing empirical evidence to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome\" --- to tell you anything except an absence of data on the question.  Noring has pointed out the catch-22 that if the \"crazy\" theory were true, you probably couldn\\'t find any direct evidence of it --- that you couldn\\'t observe those yeastie beasties with present methods even if they were there.  Noring and the fellow from Oklahoma (sorry, forgot your name) have also suggested one set of anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences --- namely, that when people with certain conditions are given anti-fungals, many of them appear to get better.    So, if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for example, controlled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals don\\'t do any better than sugar water --- then let\\'s hear it.  If you don\\'t, then what we have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side, and abject disbelief on the other.  In which case, please, there is no point in yelling back and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any convincing evidence either positive or negative.    And I understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence of people who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everything in sight, making wild claims with no evidence, and always refusing to do controlled studies.  But that has absolutely no bearing on the apparently sincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti-fungals working on themselves and other people in certain specific cases.

Same thing.  Just cause there are candida quacks, that doesn\\'t establish evidence against the candida hypothesis.  If there\\'s some other reason (besides the quacks), if only anecdotal, to think it could be true, then that is what has to be considered, that is what the net people have been talking about.  But again, there is no point in arguing about it.  There is anecdotal evidence, and there is no convincing evidence, and there are also some candida quacks out there, I hope everyone can agree on all of that.  Thus, it appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough manner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double-blind study of antifungals (or else, forget convincing anybody else to carry out the test, just carry it out themselves!) --- and also, whether they can adequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study should be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis.

       "  'We developed a toolkit running on the X Window System. The toolkit copes with any languages based on X11R5\\'s i18n facility. As you know, there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MIT\\'s  X11R5 release -- Xsi and Ximp. Our original implementation of the toolkit uses Xsi.  Our toolkit manages each character\\'s size based on our own font management system. In order to do that, the \\'wchar_t\\' typed character strings must be decomposed to character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with  ASCII and Kanji mixed, for example, is given, each element of the wchar_t array must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout and application environment\\'s locale. In this case if the locale is \\'japanese\\', each wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1, jisx0208 or so.  We need a function to do this. The function must check how many characters from the top are the same character set and what the character set is.  We could not find any public X11R5 function to do that and inevitably, used Xsi\\'s internal functions to construct that function. The following is the source code of that function \\'decomposeCharacterSet()\\'.   //I18N.h // This may look like C code, but it is really -*- C++ -*- // $Id: I18N.h,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:24 iima Exp iima $  #ifndef _I18N_H #define _I18N_H  #include <X11/Xlib.h>  extern int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str, /* IN */      int wc_len,  /* IN */      char *buf,  /* OUT */      int *buflen,  /* IN/OUT */      int *scanned_len, /* OUT */      char **charset); /* OUT */ extern XmString wcharToXmString(const wchar_t *wc_str); extern XmStringCharSet charsetOfWchar(const wchar_t wc);  #endif /* _I18N_H */  //I18N.cc /* $Id: I18N.cc,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:05 iima Exp $ */  #include <stdlib.h> #include <X11/Xlibint.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include \"I18N.h\"  extern \"C\" { #include <X11/wchar.h> #define _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset XXX_XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset #define _Xmbfscs XXX_Xmbfscs #define _Xmbctidtocsid XXX_Xmbctidtocsid #include \"Xlocaleint.h\" #undef _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset #undef _Xmbfscs #undef _Xmbctidtocsid     extern int _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(XLocale, const wchar_t*, int,       char*, int*, int*, int*);     extern Charset *_Xmbfscs(XLocale, _CSID);     extern _CSID _Xmbctidtocsid(XLocale, _CSID); };  int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,/* IN */      int wc_len,  /* IN */      char *buf,  /* OUT */      int *buf_len,  /* IN/OUT */      int *scanned_len, /* OUT */      char **charset) /* OUT */ {     XLocale xlocale = _XFallBackConvert();     int ctid;     int status;     Charset *xcharset;          status = _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(xlocale, wc_str, wc_len, buf,            buf_len, scanned_len, &ctid);     if (status == Success) {  xcharset = _Xmbfscs(xlocale, _Xmbctidtocsid(xlocale, ctid));  *charset = (xcharset) ? xcharset->cs_name : NULL;     }     else  *charset = NULL;     return status; } ----------------  An included file above, \"Xlocaleint.h\", is also Xsi internal and we copied the file to the toolkit directory and compiled.  A serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on our HP machine with its OS version of HP-UX9.01.  When we tried to link an application based on our toolkit, link errors occured saying that the following functions are missing:     _Xmbctidtocsid (code)     _Xmbfscs (code)     _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset (code)     _XFallBackConvert (code)  We had used MIT release version of X11R5 and its Xsi implementation until HP-UP9.0 and ran applications successfully. One of the reasons to use Xsi was that because HP did not release HP\\'s X11R5 until the OS 9.0 and we had no way to  know how HP\\'s R5 would be implemented. We had hoped Xsi\\'s popularity and used  its internal functions.   The HP\\'s linker complains that there are no Xsi internal functions implemented. We observe from HP\\'s libX11.a, they used some Ximp implementation but we are not sure if they used MIT\\'s vanilla Ximp version or their own version of Ximp and therefore, finding just counter part functions in MIT\\'s Ximp for Xsi does not seem to lead us a solution.  My question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like \\'decomposeCharacterset()\\' listed above. Is there any function to check character set of each element of wchar_t type strings depending on locales? If it is a public function, that is perfect but even if it is not, we want to use any internal functions in HP\\'s X11R5 as we did for MIT\\'s R5.  In order to render a \\'wchar_t\\' type string, there must be some machinery to judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for the string. We have no way to find out that without any HP\\'s X11R5 source  files. We want to know how we can use that for our goal.  Any help or comments would be highly appreciated.  I also appreciate if anyone tell me about Ximp treating around this area even if it is not HP\\'s implementation.  Thank you. ',\n",

JCAG and SDPA claim responsibility.   Source: Edward K. Boghosian, \"Radical Group Hosts Well-Attended Solidarity Meeting,\" The Armenian Reporter, May 1, 1986, pp. 1 & 18.  ATHENS, Greece - An array of representatives of Greek political parties, including the ruling PASOK party, and a host of political groups, both Armenian and non-Armenian, joined to voice their solidarity with the  Armenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new Armenian political force were voiced here on Sunday, April 20 during the 2nd International Meeting of Solidarity with the Armenian People. And judging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these political groups and organizations, at least here in Greece, the Armenian Cause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world.  The International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of the Armenian Popular Movement, a comparatively new political force headed by younger generations of Armenians, who openly profess their support of the armed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA). The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern countries and the United States although some of these branches appear to have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks of ASALA...  Voicing the support of PASOK, the ruling party in Greece, to the Armenian people, was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis, a member of the Central Committee of the party and the Greek member of the Permanent People\\'s Tribunal... Explaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement  was Ara Sarkisian. Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam  Abu-Salim, on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement\\'s continued  support of the Armenians\\' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause,  pledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be  open to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle. Later, Mr.  Abu-Salim, answering a question put to him by this writer, affirmed that  his organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that this policy will continue. \"The doors of our camps are always open to  Armenian freedom fighters,\" he affirmed.  Among the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son of Prime Minister Papandreou, who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet; two members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the specific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of the Christian Democratic party, EDIK Center party, two wings of the Communist party, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations, a number of mayors of Greek towns and cities; two Greek members of the European Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among those who participated in the international conference. Also on hand to follow the deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens.  More than significant was the large number of messages received by the  organizers, including the following: Palestinian National Revolutionary Movement, Fatah; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation Movement-Fatah; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon; Arab Socialist Labor Party; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq; and numerous other international groups, all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli- Palestinian conflict.                   SUPPORT FROM ARF-RM  Among messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Revolutionary Movement, the group that has claimed the abduction and assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to foreign interests and powers. The message clearly gave its support to the Armenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will continue to \"reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are,\" to expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag \"Bureau.\" The message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that exists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement, open supporters of ASALA and armed struggle.  The Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the Greek capital, known as Neos Kosmos, where there is a large Armenian presence. The headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth, who prefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...

Differences in the number of pages?  Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic\\'s was in 1934..  No need to use the same book size and the same letter   charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!    The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year  first published..   And you tried to hide the whole point..  the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about  how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given   by Serdar Argic exist!!   It was the issue, wasn\\'t-it?      you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway?     You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a \"crap\"..

I will dissect article-by-article, paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line,  lie-by-lie, revision-by-revision, written by those on this net, who plan  to 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is  nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide.

Also, feel  free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists, the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armenian criminal organizations.  x-Soviet Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million  Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide.  You, and those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up.  During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920,  the Armenians through a premeditated and systematic genocide,  tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against  the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and  deporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland.  The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.

       "  ' Right.  Most definitely.   This may be the root of the confusion...  Please consider the following hypothetical with an open mind.  Note that I am *not* (yet) saying that it has anything to do with the question at hand.  Suppose we have a simplified Lotto game.  You pick a number from 1-10 and win if that number is drawn.  Suppose we have a large population of people who play this game every week.  In the first year of the game, approximately 1/4 of the population will win 7 or more times.  In the second year of the game, 1/4 of those 7-time winners will again be 7-time winners.  In the third year of the game, 1/4 of those who won 7 or more times in each of the first two years will win 7 again.  Suppose I started with 1024 people in my population.  After three years, I have 32 people who have consistently, in each of the last three years, won 140% or more the number of times expected.  Do we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game? No.  Because we know there is no skill involved.  Nothing about these \"consistent winners\" can influence their chances of winning.  But suppose we *don\\'t* know whether or not there is a chance that skill might be involved.  Perhaps some of the people in our population are psychic, or something.  How would we test this hypothesis?  We can look for correlations in the population.  Now most of the population will show zero correlation.  But our psychics should show a high positive correlation (even if they aren\\'t very good psychics, they should still manage to win 7 or more times most years).  Net result?  A small positive correlation over the entire population.   Well, zero correlation is zero correlation.  You mention that Sabo has hit poorly in the clutch over the last 3(?) years.  But if we look at the past, we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse as they are to remain consistent.  The length of the streak doesn\\'t seem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be clutch or choke the next year.  Is there any reason to expect *this* streak to be different from past streaks?  Now if it were true that \"75% of all three-year streaks remained true to form\", then we might have something useful.  But then we wouldn\\'t have zero correlation.  Instead we have \"50% of all three-year streaks remain true to form, and 50% of all three-year streaks reverse\".  You look at those numbers and say \"three year choke streak implies more likely to choke this year\".  But it would be equally valid to look at those numbers and say \"three year choke streak implies more likely to be clutch this year\", since the probabilities are split 50-50 each way.   Then we would have something useful.  And we would also have a positive correlation.  But for every individual that exhibits such a pattern and holds true, there is another who exhibits such a pattern and then reverses.',\n",
       "  ' Oh contrer mon captitan!  There is a way.  Certainly it is not by human reason.  Certainly it is not by human experience. (and yet it is both!)  To paraphrase Sartre, the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point.  It is only because of God\\'s own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing.  Your logic comes to fruition in relativism.    Ah, now it is clear.  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig\\'s fame is often explained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in contemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus (\\'21) and Philosophical Investigation (\\'53).  Many of Witt\\'s comments and implicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of language he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt\\'s thought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary framework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features remain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being transcended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving us a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt\\'s own account, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that any critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to talking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but a threshold.   vonWrights\\'s comment that Witt\\'s \"sentences have a content that often lies deep beneath the surface of language.\"  On the surface, Witt talks of the insuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing ourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with Witt\\'s own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes in our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more perspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it is already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to offer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his Tractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse of the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man.  Perfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about our buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.    This is why John\\'s Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in it conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of understanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of \"as a man thinketh, so he is.\"  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside, that is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals of truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that there is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too are knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the individual.  There is, and we shouldn\\'t shy from this, a mysticism to Christianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the one who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the Spirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has the capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not only has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things of God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep things of GOd that are absolute and true.    There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced and it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy\\'s Sweetie\\'s conclusion because if it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.    \"I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would say unto me.\"  Job 23ff  --Rex',\n",

       "  \"Hi Stephen Ear wax is a healthy way to help prevent ear infections, both by preventing a barrier and also with some antibiotic properties.  Too much can block the external auditory canal (the hole in the outside of the ear) and cause some  hearing problems.  It is very simple, and safe, to remove excess wax on your own, or at your physician's office.  You can take a syringe (no needles!) and fill it with 50% warm water (cold can cause fainting) and 50% OTC hydrogen peroxide.  Then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees up) and insert the tip of the syringe (helps to have someone else do this!) and   firmly expell the solution.  Depending on the size of the syringe and the tenacity of the wax, this could take several rinses.  If you place a bowl  under the ear to catch the water, it will be much drier :-).  You can buy a syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy, or just use whatever you may have.  If wax is old, it will be harder, and darker.  You can try adding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up the wax.  Do this for a couple days, then try syringing again.  It is also safe to point your ear up at the shower head, and allow the water to rinse it out. Good Luck -heather \",\n",

       "  \"  I'd use a secret (nope, obscure) cryptographic encoding to expand the  30 bit serial number to a 64 bit block. The redundancy hereby introduced  can be used to detect tampered Clipper signals where some public enemy  replaced the L.E. block by random data.   And of course the L.E. block would be used to initialise the encryption  of the user data so that at the receiving end the correct L.E. block must  be processed in order to have any chance of getting the plaintext back.   For those of you who might want to mangle the L.E. block (e.g. by xor-ing  a constant pattern) on the transmission line and restore it before feeding  it into the receiving Crippler Chip I would add further encrypted copies  of this block (perhaps created by repeated application of the encryption  algorithm or so) at regular intervals during the transmission. If the  receiving chip detects a mismatch it must assume that the line is bad and  it will cease to work; in your own interest you are protected from getting  faulty plaintext, you know -- it's just like a checksum for your own  safety ;-(.   The `monitoring agencies' won't have the famous black box which is needed  for actual decryption and will be kept by the FBI; but nothing prevents  them from using special boxes which will do the redundancy check for the  serial number block and consistency checks on the embedded L.E. blocks  within the transmission. These boxes will turn a red light on as soon as  they detect a bitstream that violates the correct protocol.  So don't anyone think that you can use the chip and fool L.E. about the  tapping key -- I bet the developpers have provided much better checks  than those suggested above.

The original poster (W G Wright) posted an item saying that he had bought a new wizz-bang Laser Printer from Apple (a Select 300 I think) which can print GrayScale. He then said that he CANNOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer (and also that all the 'experts' he has dealt with agree that it is not possible).  This is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade (compared to Apple's SE to SE/30 upgrade): you will never be able to run Color Quickdraw. It is Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale.  SEs CAN print some COLOUR: this is because Quickdraw - the original, non-colour version, has the right hooks for eight colours. Some of you will remember the 'SCSIgraph' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE (I think that it gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something).  There is no reason that Apple couldn't release software patches for older computers (there are lots of Mac Pluses, Classics and SEs that have been upgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to deal with Color Quickdraw) - but they wont, and 3rd parties are having a difficult  time in duplicating the Mac's ROMs (i.e. Nutek et al.).

       "  'Here is some material by Michael Davies on the subject of schism in general and Archishop Lefebvre in particular.  He wrote it around 1990.  The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous activities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all that.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.  Joe Buehler  ...  Schism and Disobedience  According to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a refusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the Church united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever the subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to the Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of jurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of disobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the beginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.  The distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de Theologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is certainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father Congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther\\'s rejection of the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not constitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia explains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend \"to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.\"  It adds that \"not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this character it must include besides the transgression of the command of the superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.\"Not only does Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command, but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope\\'s authority and his intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made his attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: \"We pray for the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations last June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II the legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don\\'t even say that he is a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor heresy.\"  ...  Intrinsically Schismatic?  The principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in schism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is an intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a consecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is not true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it would always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917 Code of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see Canon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to excommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic church in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops differed radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope, that is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the illicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise an apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of jurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of ensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and also to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way the gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of bishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman Pontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the Church could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in response.  It appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop\\'s critics that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of Canon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled \"Penalties for Specific Offenses\" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The first part deals with \"Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the Church\" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon 1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together with apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses against the unity of the Church.  But the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this canon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against religion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his excommunication comes from the third section of \"Penalties for Specific Offenses\" which is entitled \"Usurpation of Ecclesial Functions and Offenses in their Exercise\" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum Usurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is Canon 1382, which reads: \"A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and the person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a pontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae) excommunication reserved to the Holy See.\"  The scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense of schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had been convicted of first degree murder.  I must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion of laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers without the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father Patrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut Catholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs actuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the illicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a parallel Church.  Cardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the Authentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations in the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to      The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not     in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with     offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses     against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are     apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a     pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the     exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the     consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh     Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated     he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because     there was no intention of a breach with the Church.  ....  It is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating bishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least intent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and will never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that the the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy, and that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon Law provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that the future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these consecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it could not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred excommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates as Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot expect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a great and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to the service of the Church and the salvation of souls.  Dr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce Association, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he knows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no greater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and the Holy See during the Archbishop\\'s lifetime. A quotation from a statement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February 1989 Remnant merits careful study:',\n",

       "  \"I just installed a Motorola XC68882RC50 FPU in an Amiga A2630 board (25 MHz 68030 + 68882 with capability to clock the FPU separately).  Previously a MC68882RC25 was installed and everything was working perfectly.  Now the systems displays a yellow screen (indicating a exception) when it check for the presence/type of FPU.  When I reinstall an MC68882RC25 the system works fine, but with the XC68882 even at 25 MHz it does not work.  The designer of the board mentioned that putting a pullup resistor on data_strobe (470 Ohm) might help, but that didn't change anything.  Does anybody have some suggestions what I could do?  Does this look like a CPU-FPU communications problem or is the particular chip dead (it is a pull, not new)? Moreover, the place I bought it from is sending me an XC68882RC33.

       "  \"I'd *desparately* prefer it if we didn't rehash the same arguments that went on ad infinitum last time.  That's especially true for sci.crypt.  For that matter, I've created alt.privacy.clipper, since the traffic is appearing in *many* different groups right now.  I'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan, hence my followup to sci.crypt.  Frankly, if you're not an absolutist, your feelings may turn on some of these issues.  For example -- with an 80-bit key, simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much less acceptable than other schemes, because it means that if just one repository is, shall we say, overly pliable, a would-be eavesdropper would need to recover just 40 more bits of key.  I need not point out in this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search. A slightly more complex scheme -- XOR-ing the key with a random number, and then with its complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys, neither of which is useful alone.  That variant is much more resistant to attack.  Clearly, one can get even more sophisticated, to protect the subkeys even more.  Other thoughts...  Some people have noted the size and complexity of the databases necessary.  But the id strings the phones emit could be their back door key, double-encrypted with the escrow repositories' public keys.  For that matter, they could do that only with session keys, and have no back door at all.  In that case, the FBI would have to bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted.  This would answer many of the objections along the lines of ``how do you make sure they stop''.  We can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back door -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed record of the time, phone number, etc, of the call.  That provides proof to the escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of the warrant.  I can suggest other variations, too.  Suppose each Clipper chip had 100 public key pairs.  Each would be used ~10 times, after which you'd need more keying material.  (Not a bad idea in any event.)  This could be used to enforce time limits, or rather, usage limits, on each warrant; the keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very long.  I suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.  Apart from the obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the back door? -- I think that the government is still genuinely concerned about foreign espionage, especially aimed at commercial targets.  This scheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it, too.  (I've heard rumors, over the years, that some factions within NSA were unhappy with DES because it was too good.  Not that they couldn't crack it, but it was much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.)  They're keeping the details secret so that others don't build their own implementations without the back door.\",\n",

       "  '(2nd posting of the question that just doesn\\'t seem to get answered)  Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains Xlib graphics.  A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea()  (or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles \"regular\" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care of rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a \"proper\" way to do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is guaranteed to be mapped.  The problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window is already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow \"tickle\" the Window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable it to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item.',\n",

       "  ' (WEBSTER:  myth:  \"a traditional or legendary story...            ...a belief...whose truth is accepted uncritically.\")  How does that qualify? Indeed, it\\'s almost oxymoronic...a rather amusing instance. I\\'ve found that most atheists hold almost no atheist-views as \"accepted uncritically,\" especially the few that are legend. Many are trying to explain basic truths, as myths do, but they don\\'t meet the other criterions. Also...   You accuse him of referencing mythology, then you procede to launch your own xtian mythology.  (This time meeting all the requirements of myth.)   Ah, but not everyone \"knows\" that god exists.  So you have a fallacy.   And that makes it true?  Holding with the Bible rules out controversy? Read the FAQ.  If you\\'ve read it, you missed something, so re-read. (Not a bad suggestion for anyone...I re-read it just before this.)   ...should I repeat what I wrote above for the sake of getting it across?  You may trust the Bible, but your trusting it doesn\\'t make it any more credible to me.  If the Bible says that everyone knows, that\\'s clearly reason to doubt the Bible, because not everyone \"knows\" your alleged god\\'s alleged existance.   1) No, they don\\'t have to ignore the Bible.  The Bible is far from universally accepted.  The Bible is NOT a proof of god; it is only a proof that some people have thought that there was a god.  (Or does it prove even that?  They might have been writing it as series of fiction short-stories.  As in the case of Dionetics.)  Assuming the writers believed it, the only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it. And that\\'s ignoring the problem of whether or not all the interpretations and Biblical-philosophers were correct.  2) There are people who have truly never heard of the Bible.  3) Again, read the FAQ.   Bzzt...wrong answer! Gravity is directly THERE.  It doesn\\'t stop exerting a direct and rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it.  God, on the other hand, doesn\\'t generally show up in the supermarket, except on the tabloids.  God doesn\\'t exert a rationally undeniable influence. Gravity is obvious; gods aren\\'t.   No, human reason hasn\\'t always come back to the existance of \"God\"; it has usually come back to the existance of \"god\". In other words, it doesn\\'t generally come back to the xtian god, it comes back to whether there is any god.  And, in much of oriental philosophic history, it generally doesn\\'t pop up as the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces are and which ones are out there.  From a world-wide view, human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to be and/or what force(s) are currently in control.  A natural tendancy to believe in \"God\" only exists in religious wishful thinking.   Xtianity is no more reasonable than most other religions, and it\\'s reasonableness certainly doesn\\'t merit eminence. Divine justice...well, it only seems just to those who already believe in the divinity. First, not all atheists believe the same things about human nature. Second, whether most atheists are correct or not, YOU certainly are not correct on human nature.  You are, at the least, basing your views on a completely eurocentric approach.

       "  ' <Moral Driver distinctions deleted>   Compare the Driver to an urge such as Jealousy, where there is an urge and an \"object\". The jealousy does not technically exist until the object is apparent. However, the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there even though it is not detectable.  Your description of the Unbilical took me three passes to understand (!) but I get the gist and I have to tentatively agree. I think our two definitions can sit side by side without too much trouble, though. I haven\\'t attempted to define the reason behind the Moral Driver (only hinted through the essence of each Moral). Your definition hints that animals are also capable of a similar morality - Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it is easy to anthropomorphize with these animals. Is this possible or have I misunderstood?   My p.s. thoughts falls roughly in line with John Stuart Mill and his writings on Utilitarianism. I have no particular plan (except to do my bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth) is that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this will probably take several generations to be effective. I don\\'t think that the list of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element may come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his transactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what gives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.  I\\'ve had some more thoughts on my definitions:  I\\'ve was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions in order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of the Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be a graphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of frequencies and the chosen \\'amplitudes\\', and the Moral Character being the spectrum over time.  Conscience is a little more difficult because I can\\'t define it as the reasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature because Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often unwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given time which compromises one\\'s Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more with Freud\\'s SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the urges or Freud\\'s Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud\\'s Ego, I suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why Conscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is \"what provides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?\". I think I need some more time with this one.  That\\'s about it for now!  David.  --- On religion:',\n",

       "  'Ensoniq SQ-80 Cross-Wave Synthesizer: I have an SQ-80 for sale.  The SQ-80 is a powerful performance oriented synth with a limited on-board sequencer.  I bought it because it has a very large timbral repertoire;  it seems to do meaty analog synth sounds as well as sounds that are considerably more \"digital\". Below are a list of features extracted from the owner\\'s manual:   o Eight-voice polyphonic poly-timbral synthesizer, capable of     playing eight different sounds at once, with dynamic stereo     panning for each voice   o Voice section employing Cross-Wave synthesis;  combine different     attack and sustain wave segments to create complex, dynamic sounds   o 75 sampled waves (includes a drumset) serve as the sound source   o Dynamic voice allocation:  each sequencer track/MIDI channel has     access to all eight voices   o A full-featured MIDI controller keyboard capable of sending eight     MIDI program and volume changes at once.  Keyboard is velocity     sensitive, and transmits/receives velocity and polyphonic aftertouch.   o Powerful matrix modulation scheme allows a very wide range of      modulation sources and routings.   o A 3.5\" floppy disk drive which writes/reads ordinary DS/DD disks     allows fast and reliable storage of up to 600 sequences and up to     1728 sound patches on a single floppy disk.  Also has a RAM-cart slot     for patches that is compatible with ESQ-1 RAM-carts.   o Does sysex dumps to its floppy disk for any sysex capable MIDI device   o 80 character fluorescent display and user-friendly \"page-driven\"     programming scheme provides a fairly humane user interface   o Stereo line-outs, and stereo headphone jack for private listening   o Sound programs and sequences are upwardly compatible with the ESQ-1     so that sounds and sequences created for the ESQ-1 can be played on     the SQ-80.  This SQ-80 has been the main MIDI controller in my studio for quite a while now.  It has performed ably in that role, and has also been a heavily used sound source at the same time.  The SQ-80 seems to have been designed with this role in mind, and it works very well with my software sequencer (WinCake) in its multitimbral mode.  short samples (there are 75 of them) as sources, then these waves are processed with a sophisticated DCF-DCA arrangement.  The SQ-80 is capable of great things because of its 4-pole analog lowpass filter. Simply put, it makes fabulous analog synth sounds.  But unlike most good analog synths, it has a very thorough MIDI implementation so that it works very well with a MIDI sequencer.  What I really like most about this thing is that it is capable of making a very wide range of sounds. This SQ-80 is about 5 years old (mfg. date 1/21/88).  It does have an 8-track sequencer, but like most on-board sequencers, it is a pain to use so I have avoided it.  REASON FOR SALE: I am selling my SQ-80 because I recently joined forces with another individual here in Boston, and we have more keyboards than space to put them.  I recommend it for someone who is getting started in sequencing and needs a powerful but economical master keyboard.  PRICING AND TERMS: I paid $1300.00 for this synth a few years ago.  I am willing to accept $650.00 (average r.m.m.s asking price is $733.00).  I will include a bunch of  patches on SQ-80 floppy disks for the buyer of this synth, as well as the  original Ensoniq SQ-80 owner\\'s manual.

       "  \" I will clarify my earlier quote.  God's laws were originally written for  the Israelites.  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to all people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of Heaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made obsolete by Jesus.  If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  If you'll notice, He also reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrived interpretations.  They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with their heads but not their hearts.  That is why He points out that our righteousness must surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom of Heaven.  People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of their way to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin. They had become legalistic, rule-makers - religious lawyers who practiced the letter of the Law but never really believed in it.    I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?  Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will. Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.

EDT                     THE PRESIDENT:  Terry, do you have a question?              Q   Mr. President, there\\'s a growing feeling that the  Western response to bloodshed in Bosnia has been woefully inadequate.   Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel asked you yesterday to do something,  anything to stop the fighting.  Is the United States considering  taking unilateral action such as air strikes against Serb artillery  sites?              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first let me say, as you know, for  more than a week now we have been seriously reviewing our options for  further action.  And I want to say, too, let\\'s look at the last three  months.  Since I became President I have worked with our allies and  we have tried to move forward, first on the no-fly zone, on  enforcement of it, on the humanitarian airdrops, on the war crimes  investigation, on getting the Bosnian Muslims involved in the peace  process.  We have made some progress.  And now we have a very much  tougher sanctions resolution.  And Leon Fuerth, who is the National  Security Advisor to the Vice President, is in Europe now working on  implementing that.  That is going to make a big difference to Serbia.              And we are reviewing other options.  I think we should  act.  We should lead -- the United States should lead.  We have led  for the last three months.  We have moved the coalition.  And to be  fair, our allies in Europe have been willing to do their part.  And  they have troops on the ground there.              But I do not think we should act alone, unilaterally,  nor do I think we will have to.  And in the next several days I think  we will finalize the extensive review which has been going on and  which has taken a lot of my time, as well as the time of the  administration, as it should have, over the last 10 days or so.  I  think we\\'ll finish that in the near future and then we\\'ll have a  policy and we\\'ll announce it and everybody can evaluate it.              Q   Can I follow up?              THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.              Q   Do you see any parallel between the ethnic  cleansing in Bosnia and the Holocaust?              THE PRESIDENT:  I think the Holocaust is on a whole  different level.  I think it is without precedent or peer in human  history.  On the other hand, ethnic cleansing is the kind of  inhumanity that the Holocaust took to the nth degree.  The idea of  moving people around and abusing them and often killing them solely  because of their ethnicity is an abhorrent thing.  And it is  especially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic  groups live side by side for so long together.  And I think you have  to stand up against it.  I think it\\'s wrong.              We were talking today about all of the other troubles in  that region.  I was happy to see the violence between the Croats and  the Muslims in Bosnia subside this morning, and I think we\\'re making  progress on that front.  But what\\'s going on with the Serbians and  the ethnic cleansing is qualitatively different than the other  conflicts, both within the former Yugoslavia and in other parts of  the region.              Q   Mr. President, by any count, you have not had a  good week in your presidency.  The tragedy in Waco, the defeat of  your stimulus bill, the standoff in Bosnia.  What did you do wrong  and what are you going to do differently?  How do you look at things?   Are you reassessing?  (Laughter.)              THE PRESIDENT:  I don\\'t really believe that the  situation in Bosnia -- it\\'s not been a good week for the world, but I  don\\'t know that the administration could have made it different.              On the stimulus package, I\\'d like to put it into the  larger context and remind you that in this 100 days we have already  fundamentally changed the direction of an American government.  We  have abandoned trickle-down economics.  We\\'ve abandoned the policies  that brought the debt of this country from $1 trillion to $4 trillion  in only a decade.                The budget plan, which passed the Congress, which will  reduce the deficit and increase investment, has led to a 20-year low  in mortgage rates, dramatically lower interest rates.  There are  probably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages  in the last three months, or who have had access to cheaper credit.   That\\'s going to put tens of billion dollars coursing throughout this  economy in ways that are very, very good for the country.  And so we  are moving in the right direction economically.              I regret that the stimulus did not pass, and I have  begun to ask -- and will continue to ask not only people in the  administration, but people in the Congress whether there is something  I could have done differently to pass that.  Part of the reason it  didn\\'t pass was politics; part of it was a difference in ideas.   There are really people still who believe that it\\'s not needed.  I  just disagree with that.                I think the recovery -- the economists say it\\'s been  underway for about two years, and we\\'ve still had 16 months of seven- percent unemployment, and all the wealthy countries are having  trouble creating jobs.  So I think there was an idea base -- an  argument there, that while we\\'re waiting for the lower interest rates  and the deficit reduction and the investments of the next four years  to take effect, this sort of supplemental appropriation should go  forward.              Now, I have to tell you, I did misgauge that because a  majority of the Republican senators now sitting in the Senate voted  for a similar stimulus when Ronald Reagan was President in 1983, and  voted 28 times for regular supplemental appropriations like this.  I  just misgauged it.  And I hope that I can learn something.  I\\'ve just  been here 90 days.  And, you know, I was a Governor working with a  contentious legislature for 12 years, and it took me a decade to get  political reform there.  So it takes time  to change things.  But I  basically feel very good about what\\'s happened in the first 100 days  with regard to the Congress.              Q   Waco --              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, with regard to Waco I don\\'t have  much to add to what I\\'ve already said.  I think it is a -- I want the  situation looked into.  I want us to bring in people who have any  insights to bear on that.  I think it\\'s very important that the whole  thing be thoroughly gone over.  But I still maintain what I said from  the beginning, that the offender there was David Koresh.  And I do  not think the United States government is responsible for the fact  that a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves.  And I\\'m sorry  that they killed their children.              Q   Mr. President, to follow up partly on Helen on your  stimulus package and on your political approach to Capitol Hill, Ross  Perot said today that you\\'re playing games with the American people  in your tax policy.  He was strongly critical of your stimulus  package.  He said he\\'s going to launch an advertising campaign  against the North American Free Trade Agreement.  How are you going  to handle his political criticism?  Will it complicate your efforts  on the Hill with your economic plan?  And do you plan to repackage  some of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to  resubmit them to the Hill?              THE PRESIDENT:  Let me answer that question first.   We\\'re going to revisit all of that over the next few days.  I\\'m going  to be talking to members of Congress and to others to see what we can  do about that.  With regard to the economic plan, I must say I found  that rather amazing.  I don\\'t want to get into an argument with Mr.  Perot.  I\\'ll be interested to hear what his specifics are, but I  would -- go back and read his book and his plan.  There\\'s a  remarkable convergence except that  we have more specific budget cuts,  we raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy.   But, otherwise, the plans are remarkably similar.                So I think it would be -- I\\'ll be interested to see if  maybe perhaps he\\'s changed his position from his book last year and  he has some new ideas to bring to bear.  I\\'ll be glad to hear them.              Q   To follow up, sir, how do you plan to handle his  political criticism?  He\\'s launched a campaign against you.  Do you  think you can sit back and just --              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I will ask you to  apply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to me.  And if he\\'s  changed his position from the positions he took in the campaign last  year, then we need to know why and what his ideas are.  Maybe he\\'s  got some constructive ideas.                I think the American people have shown that they\\'re very  impatient with people who don\\'t want to produce results.  And the one  thing I think that everybody has figured out about me in the last --  even if they don\\'t agree with what I do -- is that I want to get  something done.  I just came here to try to change things.  I want to  do things.  And I want to do things that help people\\'s lives.  So my  judgment is that if he makes a suggestion that is good, that is  constructive, that takes us beyond some idea I\\'ve proposed that will  change people\\'s lives for the better, fine.  But I think that that  ought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this  debate and not just to the President.        Q   Mr. President, to go back to Bosnia for a minute.   You continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action, a  criteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many  options thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of  paralysis.  The United States is the last remaining superpower.  Why  is it not appropriate in this situation for the United States to act  unilaterally?        THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the United States -- surely you  would agree, that the United States, even as the last remaining  superpower, has to act consistent with international law under some  mandate of the United Nations.        Q   But you have a mandate and --        THE PRESIDENT:  They do, and that is one of the things  that we have under review.  I haven\\'t ruled out any option for  action.  I would remind all of you, I have not ruled out any option,  except that we have not discussed and we are not considering the  introduction of American forces into continuing hostilities there.   We are not.          So we are reviewing other options.  But I also would  remind you that, to be fair, our allies have had -- the French, the  British and the Canadians -- have had troops on the ground there.   They have been justifiably worried about those.  But they have  supported the airdrops, the toughening of the sanctions.  They  welcomed the American delegation now in Europe, working on how to  make these sanctions really work and really bite against Serbia.  And  I can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely  reassessing their position, and I would not rule out the fact that we  can reach an agreement for a concerted action that goes beyond where  we have been.  I don\\'t have any criticism of the British, the French  and others about that.              Q   Would that be military action?              Q   Mr. President, several of the leading lights in  your administration, ranging from your FBI Director to your U.N.  Ambassador, to your Deputy Budget Director to your Health Services  Secretary, have issued statements in the last couple of weeks which  are absolutely contradictory to some of the positions you\\'ve taken in  your administration.  Why is that?  Are you losing your political  grip?              THE PRESIDENT:  Give me an example.               Q   Example?  Judge Sessions said that there was no  child abuse in Waco.  Madeleine Albright has said in this morning\\'s  newspapers, at least, that she favors air strikes in Bosnia.  All of  these are things you said that you didn\\'t support.              THE PRESIDENT:  First of all, I don\\'t know what -- we  know that David Koresh had sex with children.  I think that is  undisputed, is it not?  Is it not?  Does anybody dispute that?  Where  I come from that qualifies as child abuse.  And we know that he had  people teaching these kids how to kill themselves.  I think that  qualifies as abuse.  And I\\'m not criticizing Judge Sessions because I  don\\'t know exactly what he said.              In terms of Madeleine Albright, Madeleine Albright has  made no public statement at all about air strikes.  There is a press  report that she wrote me a confidential letter in which she expressed  her -- or memo -- in which she expressed her views about the new  direction we should take in response to my request to all the senior  members of my administration to let me know what they thought we  ought to do next.  And I have heard from her and from others about  what they think we ought to do next.  And I\\'m not going to discuss  the recommendations they made to me, but in the next few days when I  make a decision about what to do, then I will announce what I\\'m going  to do.  So I wouldn\\'t say that either one of those examples qualifies  speaking out of school.              Q   How about the Value Added Tax, Mr. President?              THE PRESIDENT:  What was that?              Q   The Value Added Tax -- Mrs. Rivlin and Miss Shalala  both said that they thought that that was a good idea.              THE PRESIDENT:  I don\\'t mind them saying they think it\\'s  a good idea.  There are all kinds of arguments for it on policy  grounds.  That does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it  in the health care debate.  No decision has been made on that.  And I  have no objection to their expressing their views on that.  We\\'ve had  a lot of people from business and labor come to us saying that they  thought that tax would help make their particular industries more  competitive in the global economy.  I took no -- that wasn\\'t taking a  line against an administration policy.              Q   Mr. President, a week ago a group of gay and  lesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed  in the most ringing terms, their confidence in your understanding of  them and their political aspirations, and their belief that you would  fulfill those aspirations.  Do you feel now that you will be able to  meet their now enhanced expectations?              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don\\'t know about that.  And I  don\\'t know what their -- it depends on what the expectations are.   But I\\'ll tell you this:  I believe that this country\\'s policies  should be heavily biased in favor of nondiscrimination.  I believe  when you tell people they can\\'t do certain things in this country  that other people can do, there ought to be an overwhelming and  compelling reason for it.  I believe we need the services of all of  our people, and I have said that consistently.  And not as a  political proposition.  The first time this issue came up was in 1991  when I was in Boston.  I was just asked the question about it.              And I might add -- it\\'s interesting that I have been  attacked -- obviously, those who disagree with me here are primarily  coming from the political right in America.  When I was Governor, I  was attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights  of religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to  practice home schooling under appropriate safeguards.  I just have  always had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect  the rights of American individual citizens to live up to the fullest  of their capacities, and I\\'m going to stick right with that.              Q   Are you concerned, sir, that you may have generated  expectations on their end and criticism among others that has  hamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis  on this issue?              THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, but I have not placed a great deal  of emphasis on it.  It\\'s gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters   and in the press.  I\\'ve just simply taken my position and tried to  see it through.  And that\\'s what I do.  It doesn\\'t take a lot of my  time as President to say what I believe in and what I intend to do,  and that\\'s what I\\'ll continue to do.              Q   Mr. President, getting back to the situation in  Bosnia -- and we understand you haven\\'t made any final decisions on  new options previously considered unacceptable.  But the two most  commonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable  the Bosnian Muslims to defend themselves and to initiate some limited  air strikes, perhaps, to cut off supply lines.  Without telling us  your decision -- presumably, you haven\\'t made any final decisions on  those two options -- what are the pros and cons that are going  through your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final  decision?                THE PRESIDENT:  I\\'m reluctant to get into this.  There  are -- those are two of the options.  There are some other options  that have been considered.  All have pluses and minuses; all have  supporters and opponents within the administration and in the  Congress, where, I would remind you, heavy consultations will be  required to embark on any new policy.              I do believe that on the air strike issue, the  pronouncements that General Powell has made generally about military  action, apply there.  If you take action, if the United States takes  action, we must have a clearly-defined objective that can be met.  We  must be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear.  The  United States is not, should not, become involved as a partisan in a  war.                With regard to the lifting of the arms embargo, the  question obviously there is if you widen the capacity of people to  fight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace?  Will  it lead to more bloodshed?  What kind of reaction can others have  that would undermine the effectiveness of the policy?              But I think both of them deserve some serious  consideration, along with some other options we have.              Q   Do you think that these people who are trying to  get us into war in Bosnia are really remembering that we haven\\'t  taken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war and  we couldn\\'t take care of our prisoners and get them all home from  Vietnam?   And now many of them are coming up with bills for  treatment of Agent Orange.  How can we afford to go to any more of  these wars?              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that\\'s a good argument  against the United States itself becoming involved as a belligerent  in a war there.  But we are, after all, the world\\'s only super power.   We do have to lead the world  and there is a very serious problem of  systematic ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, which could  have not only enormous further humanitarian consequences -- and  goodness knows there have been many -- but also could have other  practical consequences in other nearby regions where the same sorts  of ethnic tensions exist.        Q   Did you make any kind of agreement with Boris  Yeltsin to hold off either on air strikes or any kind of aggressive  action against the Serbs until after Sunday?  And in general, how has  his political situation affected your deliberation on Bosnia?        THE PRESIDENT:  No, I have not made any agreement, and  he did not ask for that.  We never even discussed that, interestingly  enough.  The Russians, I would remind you, in the middle of President  Yeltsin\\'s campaign, abstained from our attempt to get tougher  sanctions through the United Nations in what I thought was the proper  decision for them and one that the United States and, I\\'m sure, the  rest of the free world very much appreciated.         Q   Do you wish, Mr. President, that you\\'d become more  involved in the planning of the Waco operation?  And how would you  handle that situation differently now?        THE PRESIDENT:  I don\\'t think as a practical matter that  the President should become involved in the planning of those kinds  of things at that detail.  One of the things that I\\'m sure will come  out when we look into this is -- the questions will be asked and  answered, did all of us who up the line of command ask the questions  we should have asked and get the answers we should have gotten?  And  I look forward to that.  But at the time, I have to say, as I did  before, the first thing I did after the ATF agents were killed, once  we knew that the FBI was going to go in, was to ask that the military  be consulted because of the quasi, as least, military nature of the  conflict given the resources that Koresh had in his compound and  their obvious willingness to use them.  And then on the day before  the action, I asked the questions of the Attorney General which I  have reported to you previously, and which at the time I thought were  sufficient.  I have -- as I said, I\\'m sure -- I leave it to others to  make the suggestions about whether there are other questions I should  have asked.              Q   Mr. President, what is your assessment of Director  Sessions\\' role in the Waco affair?  And have you made a decision on  his future?  And if you haven\\'t, will you give him a personal hearing  before you do decide?              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I have no assessment  of his role since I had no direct contact with him.  And I mean no  negative or positive inference.  I have no assessment there.  I stand  by what I said before about my general high regard for the FBI.  And  I\\'m waiting for a recommendation from the Attorney General about what  to do with the direction of the FBI.              Q   Mr. President, since you said that one side in  Bosnia conflict represents inhumanity that the Holocaust carried to  the nth degree, why do you then tell us that the United States cannot  take a partisan view in this war?              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I said that the principle of  ethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up against.  That  does not mean that the United States or the United Nations can enter  a war, in effect, to redraw the lines, geographical lines of  republics within what was Yugoslavia, or that that would ultimately  be successful.              I think what the United States has to do is to try to  figure out whether there is some way consistent with forcing the  people to resolve their own difficulties we can stand up to and stop  ethnic cleansing.  And that is obviously the difficulty we are  wrestling with.  This is clearly the most difficult foreign policy  problem we face, and that all of our allies face.  And if it were  easy, I suppose it would have been solved before.  We have tried to  do more in the last 90 days than was previously done.  It has clearly  not been enough to stop the Serbian aggression, and  we are now  looking at what else we can do.              Q   Yesterday you specifically criticized the Roosevelt  administration for not having bombed the railroads to the  concentration camps and things that were near military targets.   Aren\\'t there steps like that that would not involve conflict --direct  conflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider?              THE PRESIDENT:  There may be.  I would remind you that  the circumstances were somewhat different.  We were then at war with  Germany at the time and that\\'s what made that whole incident so -- series of incidents -- so perplexing.  But we have -- as I say, we\\'ve  got all of our options under review.              Q   The diplomatic initiative on Haiti is on the verge  of collapse.  What can you do to salvage it short of a full-scale  military operation?              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you may know something I don\\'t.   That\\'s not what our people tell me.  I think Mr. Caputo and  Ambassador Pezzullo have done together a good job.  The thing keeps  going back and forth because of the people who are involved with the  de facto government there.  It\\'s obvious what their concerns are.   They were the same concerns that led to the ouster of Aristide in the  first place, and President Aristide, we feel, should be restore d to  power.  We\\'re working toward that.  I get a report on that -- we  discuss it at least three times a week, and I\\'m convinced that we\\'re  going to prevail there and be successful.                I do believe that there\\'s every reason to think that  there will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to  guarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on  both sides of the ledger while we try to establish the conditions of  ongoing civilized society.  But I believe we\\'re going to prevail  there.              Q   Mr. President, would you care to make your  assessment of the first 100 days before we make one for you?   (Laughter.)              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I\\'ll say if -- I believe, first of  all, we passed the budget resolution in record time.  That was the  biggest issue.  That confirmed the direction of the administration  and confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both  bring the deficit down and increase investment, and that we could do  it by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes, almost all of  which come from the highest income people in this society --reversing  a 12-year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the  middle class, whose incomes were going down when their taxes were  going up, while the deficit went from $1 trillion to $4 trillion, the  total national debt, and the deficit continued to go up.              We have a 20-year low in interest rates from mortgages.  We have lower interest rates across the board.  We have tens of  billions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people  refinance their debt.                We have established a new environmental policy, which is  dramatically different.  The Secretary of Education has worked with  me and with others and with the governors to establish a new approach  in education that focuses on tough standards, as well as increasing  opportunity.  We have done an enormous amount of work on political  reform, on campaign finance and lobbying reform.  And I have imposed  tough ethics requirements on my own administration\\'s officials.   These things are consistent with not only what I said I\\'d do in the  campaign, but with turning the country around.  The Vice President is  heading a task force which will literally change the way the federal  government operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens  of this country.                We are working on a whole range of other things.  The  welfare reform initiative, to move people from welfare to work.  And,  of course, a massive amount of work has been done on the health care  issue, which is a huge economic and personal security problem for  millions of Americans.                So I think it is amazing how much has been done.  More  will be done.  We also passed the Family Leave bill.  A version of  the motor voter bill -- that has not come out of conference back to  me yet.  And everything has been passed except the stimulus program.   So I think we\\'re doing fine and we\\'re moving in the right direction.   I feel good about it.              Q   Sir, a follow-up.  Wouldn\\'t you say, though, that  one of your biggest initiatives, aid to Soviet Russia, is now  practically finished -- if we can\\'t pass a stimulus bill in our own  country, how can we do it for them?              THE PRESIDENT:  Let me recast the question a little bit.   It\\'s a good question -- (laughter) -- it\\'s a good question, but to be  fair we\\'ve got to recast it.  We have already -- the first round of  aid to the Soviet -- to non-Soviet Russia, to a democratic Russia, is  plainly going to go through, the first $1.6 billion.  The aid that we  agreed with our partners in the G-7 to provide through the  international financial institutions, which is a big dollar item, is  plainly going to go through.  The question is, can we get any more  aid for Russia that requires a new appropriation by the United States  Congress?  And that is a question I think, Mary, that will be  resolved in the weeks ahead, in part by what happens to the American  workers and their jobs and their future.  I think the two things will  be tied by many members of Congress.        Q   The tailhook report came out this morning,  documenting horrendous and nearly-criminal conduct on the part of the  Navy.  How much did you discuss the incident and what might be done  about it with your nominee to be the Secretary of the Navy?        THE PRESIDENT:  First, let me comment a little on that.   The Inspector General\\'s report details conduct which is wrong and  which has no place in the armed services.  And I expect the report to  be acted on in the appropriate way.  I also want to say to the  American people and to all of you that the report should be taken for  what it is, a very disturbing list of allegations which will have to  be thoroughly examined.  It should not be taken as a general  indictment of the United States Navy or of all the fine people who  serve there.  It is very specific in its allegations, and it will be  pursued.          The only thing I said to the Secretary-Designate of the  Navy and the only thing I should have said to him, I think, is that I  expected him to take the report and to do his duty.  And I believe he  will do that.        Q   Mr. President, to back to Russia for just a minute.   The latest poll show that Mr. Yeltsin will probably win his vote of  confidence.  But there seems to be a real toss-up on whether or not  voters are going to endorse his economic reforms.          THE PRESIDENT:  I understand that.          Q   Can you live with a split -- (laughter) -- can you  live with a split decision, though, or do you need both passed in  order to then build support for Russian aid?        THE PRESIDENT:  I believe -- the answer to your question  is, for the United States, the key question should be that which is  posed to any democracy, which is who wins the election.  If he wins  the election, if he is ratified by the Russian people to continue as  their President, then I think we should do our best to work with him  toward reform.              You know, we had a lot of other countries here for the  Holocaust Museum dedication -- their leaders were here.  Leaders from  Eastern Europe, leaders from at least one republic of the former  Soviet Union; all of them having terrible economic challenges as they  convert from a communist command and control economy to a market  economy in a world where there\\'s economic slowdown everywhere.  And  in a world in which there\\'s economic slowdown and difficulty, all  leaders will have trouble having their policies be popular in a poll  because they haven\\'t produced the results that the people so  earnestly yearn for.  You can understand that.                But if they have confidence in the leadership, I think  that\\'s all we can ask.  And the United States will -- if the Russian  people ratify him as their President and stick with him then the  United States will continue to work with him.  I think he is a  genuine democrat -- small d -- and genuinely committed to reform.  I  think that we should support that.        Q   Mr. President, Mr. Perot has come out strongly in  what is perceived behind the line against a free trade agreement -- NAFTA.  How hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement  and when do you expect to see it accomplished?              THE PRESIDENT:  I think we\\'ll have the agreement ready  in the fairly near future.  You know, our people are still working  with the Mexican government and with the Canadians on the side  agreements.  We\\'re trying to work out what the environmental  agreement will say, what the labor agreement will say, and then what  the fairest way to deal with enforcement is.                The Mexicans say, and there is some merit to their  position, that they\\'re worried about transferring their sovereignty  in enforcement to a multilateral commission.  Even in the United  States, to be fair, we have some folks who are worried about that -- about giving that up.  On the other hand, if we\\'re going to have an  environmental agreement and a labor standards agreement that means  something,  then there has to be ultimately some consequences for  violating them.  So what we\\'re trying to do is to agree on an  approach which would say that if there is a pattern of violations -- if you keep on violating it past a certain point -- maybe not an  isolated incident, but a pattern of violation -- there is going to be  some enforcement.  There must be consequences.  And we\\'re working out  the details of that.              But I still feel quite good about it.  And this is just  an area where I disagree with Mr. Perot and with others.  I think  that we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more  closely the Mexican economy and the American economy and leads us  from there to Chile to other market economies in Latin America, and  gives us a bigger world in which to trade.  I think that\\'s the only  way a rich country can grow richer.  If you look at what Japan and  other countries in the Pacific are doing to reach out in their own  region, it\\'s a pretty good lesson to us that we had better worry  about how to build those bridges in our own area.                So this is an idea battle.  You know, you\\'ve got a lot  of questions and I want to answer them all, but let me say not every  one of these things can be distilled simply into politics -- you  know, who\\'s for this and who\\'s for that, and if this person is for  this, somebody else has got to be for that.  A lot of these things  honestly involved real debates over ideas, over who\\'s right and wrong  about the world toward which we\\'re moving.  And the answers are not  self-evident.  And one of the reasons that I wanted to run for  President is I wanted to sort of open the floodgates for debating  these ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate way.   So I just have a difference of opinion.  I believe that the concept  of NAFTA is sound, even though, as you know, I thought that the  details needed to be improved.              Q   Mr. President, there was a tremendous flurry of  interest earlier this month in the Russian document that purported to  show that the Vietnamese had held back American prisoners.  General  Vessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was  authentic, he believes that it was incorrect.  Do you have a personal  view at this point about that issue?  And more broadly, do you  believe that, in fact, the Vietnamese did return all the American  prisoners at the time of the Paris Peace Accord?              THE PRESIDENT:  First let me say, I saw General Vessey  before he went to Vietnam and after he returned.  And I have a high  regard for him and I appreciate his willingness to serve his country  in this way.  As to whether the document had any basis in fact, let  me say that the government of Vietnam was more forthcoming than it  had been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to  undermine the validity of the Russian documents claim.              I do not know whether that is right or wrong.  We are  having it basically evaluated at this time, and when we complete the  evaluation, we\\'ll tell you.  And, of course, we want to tell the  families of those who were missing in action or who were POWs.  I  think that we\\'ll be able to make some progress in eliminating some of  the questions about the outstanding cases as a result of this last  interchange, but I cannot say that I\\'m fully satisfied that we know  all that we need to know.  There are still some cases that we don\\'t  know the answer to.  But I do believe we\\'re making some progress.  I  was encouraged by the last trip.              Q   I\\'d like to follow up on that.  Before the U.S.  normalizes relations, allows trade to go forward, do you have to be  personally sure that every case has been resolved or would you be  willing to go forward on the basis that while it may take years to  resolve these cases, the Vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to  us to confirm good faith?              THE PRESIDENT:  A lot of experts say you can never  resolve every case, every one, that we couldn\\'t resolve all the cases  for them and that there are still some cases that have not been  factually resolved, going back to the Second World War.  But what I  would have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward  resolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time,  and that there was a complete, open and unrestricted commitment to  continue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving  those cases.  And we\\'re not there yet.                Again, I have to be guided a little bit by people who  know a lot about this.  And I confess to being much more heavily  influenced by the families of the people whose lives were lost there,  or whose lives remain in question than by the commercial interest and  the other things which seem so compelling in this moment.  I just am  very influenced by how the families feel.              Q      your economic stimulus package, are you doing  some kind of reality check now and scaling back some of your plans,  your legislative plans for the coming year, including the crime bill,  the health care initiative and other things?  Are there any plans to  do that?  And also, did you underestimate the power of Senator Bob  Dole?              THE PRESIDENT:  No, what I underestimated was the extent  to which what I thought was a fairly self-evident case, particularly  after we stayed below the spending caps approved by this Congress,  including the Republicans who were in this Congress last year -- when  we had already passed a budget resolution which called for over $500  billion in deficit reduction.  When they had voted repeatedly for  supplemental appropriations to help foreign governments, I thought at  least four of them would vote to break cloture, and I underestimated  that.  I did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with that.                I also thought that if I made a good-faith effort to  negotiate and to compromise, that it would not be rebuffed.  Instead,  every time I offered something they reduced the offer that they had  previously been talking to the Majority Leader about.  So it was a  strange set of events.  But I think what happened was what was a  significant part of our plan, but not the major part of it, acquired  a political connotation that got out of proportion to the merits, so  that a lot of Republicans were saying to me privately, \"Mr.  President, I\\'d like to be for this, but I can\\'t now.  And we\\'re all  strung out and we\\'re divided.\"                And I think we need to do a reality check.  As I said,  what I want to know -- let me go back to what I said -- what I want  to know from our folks and from our friends in the Senate on -- and  Republicans or Democrats -- is what could I have done differently to  make it come out differently.  Because the real losers here were not  the President and the administration.  The real losers were the  hundreds of thousands of people who won\\'t have jobs now.  We could  have put another 700,000 kids to work this summer.  I mean, we could  have done a lot of good things with that money.  And I think that is  very, very sad.  And it became more political than it should have.   But the underlying rationale I don\\'t think holds a lot of water -- that it was deficit spending.  That just won\\'t wash.              Q      and redo --              THE PRESIDENT:  No.  I mean, you know, for example --you  mentioned the crime bill.  I think it would be a real mistake not to  pass the crime bill.  I mean, the crime bill was almost on the point  of passage last year.  And they were all fighting over the Brady  Bill.  Surely, surely after what we have been through in this country  just in the last three months, with the kind of mindless violence we  have seen, we can pass a bill requiring people to go through a  waiting period before they buy a handgun.  And surely we can see that  we need more police officers on the street.                That\\'s another thing that -- I really believe that once  we move some of that money -- not all, but some of it up into this  jobs package to make some of the jobs rehiring police officers on the  street wh o\\'d been laid off, that would be a compelling case.  I mean  people are scared in this country and I think we need to go forward.  I feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill.              Q   Mr. President, back to the tailhook report for a  second.  That report contained very strong criticism of the Navy\\'s  senior leadership in general, but did not name any of the senior  officers.  Do you believe that the senior officers who are implicated  in this, including Admiral Kelso who was there one night in Las  Vegas, should they be disciplined and do you believe the public has a  right to know the names of the senior officers?              THE PRESIDENT:  You should know that under the rules of  law which apply to this, I am in the chain of command.  There is now  an Inspector General\\'s report and the law must take its course.  If I  were to answer that question I might prejudice any decisions which  might be later made in this case.  I don\\'t really think -- I think  all I can tell you is what I have already said.  I was very disturbed  by the specific allegations in the Inspector General\\'s report, and I  want appropriate action to be taken.                Until the proper procedures have a chance to kick in and  appropriate action is taken, I have been advised that because I am  the Commander-in-Chief I have to be very careful about what I say so  as not to prejudice the rights of anybody against whom any action  might proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or  con.  So I can\\'t say any more except to say that I want this thing  handled in an appropriate and thorough way.              Q   Mr. President, could I ask you for a clarification  on Bosnia?  You said that you were not considering introduction of  American forces.  Does that include any air forces as well as ground  forces, sir?              THE PRESIDENT:  I said ground forces.              Q   You said ground forces.  Could I ask you, sir, if  you fear that using U.S. air strikes might  draw the United States  into a ground war there?              THE PRESIDENT:  I just don\\'t want to discuss our  evaluation of the options anymore.  I\\'ve told you that there\\'s never  been a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of  ground forces into an ongoing conflict there.              Q   With hundreds of thousands of gays in Washington  this weekend for the march, did you ever reconsider your decision to  leave town for this weekend?  Did you ever consider in any way  participating in some of the activities?               THE PRESIDENT:  No.              Q   Why not?              THE PRESIDENT:  Because I -- and, basically, I wouldn\\'t  participate in other marches.  I think once you become President, on  balance, except under unusual circumstances, that is not what should  be done.  But more importantly, I\\'m going to the American Society of  Newspaper Editors, a trip that presumably most of you would want me  to make, to try to focus anew on what I think are the fundamental  issues at stake for our country right now.  And I expect that I will  say something about the fact that a lot of Americans have come here,  asking for a climate that is free of discrimination; asking,  basically, to be able to work hard and live by the rules and be  treated like other American citizens if they do that, and just that.   And that\\'s always been my position -- not only for the gays who will  be here, but for others as well.                Thank you very much.',\n",
       "  \" Here again, the problem with most of the individuals posting here, you take the biblical account as though it were some sort of historical recounting in the modern sense.  I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book _The Cross That Spoke_ (Pub. Harper and Row, 1988).  The earliest texts which we have make no reference to an empty tomb.  Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of resurrection. Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed what the point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburg's work  _Resurrection, Immortality, and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ (Publ Cambridge, Havard Univ. Press, 1972) is most helpful.  Look At Rom 1:1-3.  Paul here has no need of an empty tomb.  Additionally in 1 Cor 15, Here again there is no mention of an empty tomb. He was raised (note the passive), he appeared, no ascension either.  Resurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the grave.  The whole idea of an empty tomb isn't broached in any of our texts until well after the fall of Jerusalem.  By that time, the idea of coming up with a body would have been ludicrious.  Moreover Mack has argued (convicingly, I think) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark (we have no texts before this which mention the tomb).         You are quite right here.  Even the Idea of a subjective mystical event as the foundation of the resurrection narratives is currently becoming more untenable. See B. Mack _A Myth of Innocence_.\",\n",

       "  '  The problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators, and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply.  Unfortunately, the specification for XGrabKey doesn\\'t allow AnyModifier to be combined with other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case: \"Ctrl Any<Key>q\".   This is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using event handlers instead of grabs; it\\'s not true for menu accelerators.  If you\\'re a Motif implementor, I\\'d suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics changed to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user\\'s expectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as translations.   If you mean \"menu accelerator\", no it\\'s not possible.  That\\'s according to the definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.   I can\\'t think of a reason why not.   There is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu accelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators resource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell\\'s accelerators on itself and all of its descendants with XtInstallAllAccelerators (shell, shell).  For example,    applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade        -- filePulldown - openPushbutton          - exitPushbutton    *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O   *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O   *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q   *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q    *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\\\\n\\\\     Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\\\\n\\\\     Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)  You have to write and add the application action PerformAction, which you can implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then XtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments.  I tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time, I used TeleUSE\\'s TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators on the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead of asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I described above should work.',\n",

There's no way to be sure, of course, but the only hitters the Skydome seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters, and Alomar is not a home run hitter.   Only because of t&P's bogus fielding stats, which rate Alomar as the worst defensive second baseman in the league.  On a career basis, I think T&P's fielding stats may mean something, but on a seasonal basis it comes up with ridiculous results like this.  Alomar may not be the god of fielding the media says he is, but he sure isn't the worst in baseball.  Offensively, T&P rate Alomar much higher last year.

       "  ' There are two things at work here ... the public insurance is very wide in what it will cover, as the amortization is also universal. No private plan can boast of a plan that fits a Gaussian curve ... and as our private sector has discovered, they\\'re better off not offering insurance coverage that their customers are going to use. (-;   The alternative to the system is no system at all (patients opted out, doctors opted out, or both).  But that only for insurance ... and you can\\'t force a private insurance company to sell you a plan that they will not offer.  And remember that the actual health care is delivered by private entities who collect from the public insurance voluntarily. Again, they can\\'t force a private entity to spring to life to pay them.  Plus, there is the matter of culture and values ...

Yes, primarily in Quebec and in Alberta.  Sorry, I musta lost you in that verbose blurb ...   In Canada and Germany, it\\'s not mandatory.  However, it is negative option in that you must request the exemption.  That the private sector will not provide private basic coverage if offered the option (as in the Quebec case) tells me something about what they know ...   Yes, but part of the reason is that our most of our markets are too small to sustain many specialists, sometimes not even one, so you pretty well have to be a GP to get paid.  And if you do get the training, the doctors monopoly might block your getting of a licence because there is already someone in the business and who cannot fill his/her appointment book.  That we have a CMA doctors monopoly is something that the American AMA-oriented medical lobby NEVER tells you down here ...   No, I respect people who do specialties (okay, all of my MD friends are (-;) but there\\'s the question of our small market dynamics up north ... if anything, that our private doctors and hospitals sell their services to Americans to generate more business will inflate their effective population served, and thus make some specialties finally viable (i.e., there will be enough customers).  We just do not have enough sick Canadians in absolute numbers otherwise.   Uh ... Germany basically uses our method, with their many sickness funds.  The competition is fake if it exists at all, because they\\'re all interlinked.  Look in Der Spiegel or Stern (my girlfriend is in our German department  and her uncle is a private practicioner in Saarbrucken) ... no ads for health insurance.  While Canada organizes by province, Germany organizes the paperwork around big corporations and regional offices.   But remember that we have provinces that have the same population as some major German corporations.  Germans have public health insurance, just that it is brokered by smaller entities (actually, brokerage of basic by private firms who\\'ll sell extra insurance to fill out their policies, sort of a voucher system, was one of the first ideas floated in Canada, too).  Remember, the Germans don\\'t have HMO\\'s ... a telling sign, \\'cos Rochester does and they\\'re also a company town.

(Command-line flag is -ghbnie.)   o Explicitly pop down all dialog boxes when document view    window is closed, for window managers too dull to do so    themselves.   o Better visited anchor color for non-SGI's.   o Added .hqx and .uu to list of file extensions handled like .tar files.   o Added 'Clear' button to Open box, to allow more convenient    cut-n-paste entries of URL's.   o New resource 'autoPlaceWindows'; if set to False, new document    view windows will not be automatically positioned by the    program itself (but it's still up to your window manager just how    they're placed).   o Command-line flags -i and -iconic now have desired effect (new    resource initialWindowIconic can also be used).   o Gif-reading code is a little more bulletproof.   o Obscure infinite loop triggered by extra space in IMG tag fixed.   o Eliminated nonintuitive error message when image can't be read    (inlined NCSA bitmap is indication enough that something's not    right for authors, and readers can't do anything about bad images    in any case).   o Obscure parsing bug (for constructs like <ADDRESS><A    HREF=...>text<A></ADDRESS>) fixed.   o Fixed mysterious stupid coredump that only hits Suns.   o Fixed stupid coredump on URL's like '://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/'.   o Fixed buglet in handling rlogin URL's.   o New support for Solaris/SYSVR4 (courtesy    dana@thumper.bellcore.com).   o Better support for HP-UX 8.x and 9.x (courtesy    johns@hpwarf.wal.hp.com).   o Better support for NeXT (courtesy scott@shrug.dur.ac.uk).   o Some miscellaneous portability fixes (courtesy    bingle@cs.purdue.edu).   o Miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanups.   Comments, questions, and bug reports should be sent to mosaic-x@ncsa.uiuc.edu.  Thanks in advance for any feedback you can provide.  Cheers, Marc  --\",\n",

These   are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the   performance of your workstation.    Well, more hardware isn\\'t always an option, and I wonder if more   hardware is always even a necessity.    This \"FAQ\" list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different   people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X   Windows on your workstation, WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE.    Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must   balance `speed\\' versus `features\\' in order to come to a personal   decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many   subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts.    This document is specifically concerned with X.  There are of course   many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation.   However, they are outside the scope of this document.      [ People seriously interested in the whole area of system     performance, might want to look at the O\\'Reilly Nutshell Handbook     \"System Performance Tuning\" by Mike Loukides.  IMHO, it contains a     well-written, comprehensive treatment of system performance.  I\\'m     unaware of any other similar books.  --ed.]  ----------------- Table of Contents -----------------   0.

If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few   months old (see the \"Last-modified\" date above) you should probably   locate the latest edition, since the information may be outdated.    If you do not know how to get those newsgroups and/or your site does   not receive them and/or this article has already expired, you can   retrieve this FAQ from an archive site.    There exist several usenet FAQ archive sites.  To find out more about   them and how to access them, please see the \"Introduction to the   news.answers newsgroup\" posting in news.answers.

Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and   well written \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" document.   Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates   on performance.    The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with   regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:  \"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4\".   (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).  --------------- Window Managers ---------------    There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different   features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a   balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this   point, most respondents have agreed upon \"twm\" as the best candidate   for a speedy window manager.     A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,   is turning off unnecessary things like \"zooming\" and \"opaque move\".   Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the   amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping   windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)    I\\'ve found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:   -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is   the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)   and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the   display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.  ------------ The X Server ------------  Which Server? - - - - - - -   Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.   If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.    On my Monochrome Sun, I haven\\'t noticed much difference between   the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to   me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute   to less paging.            [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),                         Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]    How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law   (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be   compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.   You can expect to get \"*very* large speedups in the server\" by not   using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results   would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial   compilers on the market.  Locking the Server into RAM? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and   does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help   performance at all?  I\\'ve had one inquiry on this topic, and a few   pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone   who\\'s tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.        [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),           Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),           Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ] Starting your Server - - - - - - - - - - -   Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :     If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep     for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my     .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...     we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.    This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!      Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of   why this works, which I have summarized here:      When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to     start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by     the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of     pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the     server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you     put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself     sorted out before the clients start up.      Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X     client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources     being fetched, programs initializing state and \"databases\" and so     forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this     initialization is done (\"The process has reached a steady state\"),     the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.     By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your     .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your     workstation\\'s limited resources    This is most definitely a \"Your Mileage May Vary\" situation, as there   are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap   space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients   you are starting, etc.    Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:  (sleep 1; exec xclock ) &  (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &    I\\'ve experimented with:  (sleep 1; exec xclock ) &  (sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &  (sleep 3; exec xterm ) &  (sleep 4; exec xterm ) &    I\\'ve even tried:  (sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &   and then in start_X_clients_script I had:  (sleep 1; exec xclock ) &  (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &      [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had     completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down     into a \"steady state\" before the sleep expired and all my clients     were launched. ]    All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with   my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to   experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.  Fonts - - -   Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts   your applications use, you\\'ll get speed increases in load-up time.    One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one   large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or   at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.   Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded   into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer   fonts will be loaded by the server.          [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),            Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]    eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13   in all it\\'s menus and icons etc.  Twm\\'s default font is 8x13.  Since   I don\\'t normally use 8x13, I\\'ve eliminated one font from my server.    Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):     Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.     If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.  About the Resources File - - - - - - - - - - - - -      Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves     on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)    One suggestion:      In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum     number of resources that you want to have available to all of your     applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true      Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific     resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your     .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:   setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N      [ The \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" FAQ contains     an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.     --ed.]      So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from     .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,     and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same     XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system     app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to     find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files     with the same name.      This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).       [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),            Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),                and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).       Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]    This method of organizing your personal resources has the following   benefits:      - Easier to maintain / more usable.      - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER       property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally       quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.      - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort        through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.    It also has drawbacks:      - the application that you are interested in has to load an       additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn\\'t seem to       make that much of a performance difference, and you might       consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an       application\\'s resource database, you just need to re-run the       application without having to \"xrdb\" again.      - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When       your resources are split out into multiple resource files and       then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.       WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!        I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped       out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource       files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why       my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*       provide any error message when it encountered the C style       comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted       processing the resource file.        The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef       COLOR\\'\\' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this       method of resource management.      - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For       example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their       resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.      - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files       with the machine where your resources are stored, your client       will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the       server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find       their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)    A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)   is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my   .Xdefaults file, and to use the \"separate resources files\" method for   clients that I seldom use.  Define Your Display Properly - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In   that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to    \"<hostname>:0.0\", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you   should set your DISPLAY variable to \"unix:0.0\" or \":0.0\".  By doing this   you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same   machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.    [thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]    See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further   explanation of how to properly set your display name.    \"I don\\'t think it\\'s stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have   libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when   the DISPLAY isn\\'t set specially.\"          Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)    [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change   stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.   I don\\'t want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle   non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT   will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if   you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]  ------- Clients -------    If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think   carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also   about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there   a smaller clock program than xclock?    Unfortunately, I haven\\'t really noticed that programs advertise how large   they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.    [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients   (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]    I\\'ve received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject   of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are   strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather   large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using   may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In   this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually   _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.    The upshot of all this seems to be: Don\\'t mix toolkits.  That is, try   and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif   clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you\\'re dragging in   more than one toolkit library.    Know your environment, and think carefully about which client   programs would work best together in that environment.

You don\\'t have to    rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it\\'s current    version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I\\'ve heard that    there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I\\'ve not found any    yet.     UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with    Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He    questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For    instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling    speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap    bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm    may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don\\'t have any hard    numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text    segments mean that xterm\\'s paging requirements are not that major.

From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif   Text Field Widgets:      I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets, I     was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes,     particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was     going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource     XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget     (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.     Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the     widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user     can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not     noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference     on a [slower system].    This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots   of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor   embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server   requests?  ------------------------- Miscellaneous Suggestions -------------------------  Pretty Pictures - - - - - - - -   Don\\'t use large bitmaps (GIF\\'s, etc) as root window backgrounds.    - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server     is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)    - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I\\'m     conscious of performance issues, I can\\'t comprehend it when I see     people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.      I\\'ll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by     having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.    - If you\\'re anything like me, you need all the screen real estate     that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.          [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu)     for reminding me of this one. --ed.]  A Quicker Mouse - - - - - - - -   Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen   when you move your mouse.  I use \"xset m 3 10\" in my .xinitrc file,   which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of   the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.    Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for   fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different   mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.      e.g. (for twm) :       menu \"mouse settings\" {         \"Mouse Settings:\"   f.title  \"  Very Fast\"    ! \"xset m 7 10 &\"  \"  Normal (Fast)\"   ! \"xset m 3 10 &\"  \"  System Default (Un-Accelerated)\" ! \"xset m default &\"  \"  Glacial\"    ! \"xset m 0 10 &\"       }  Programming Thoughts - - - - - - - - - - -   Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :     To speed up applications that you\\'re developing, there are tons of     things you can do.  Some that stick out:      - For Motif programs, don\\'t set XmFontList resources for individual       buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or       labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager       widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.      - Better yet, don\\'t use Motif at all.  It\\'s an absolute pig.      - Don\\'t create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.       (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)      - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE       difference.      - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the       difference between a fast application and a completely unusable       one.    Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :     Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc     function would greatly increase performance of Xt based     applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying     out the GNUY malloc, but I didn\\'t find the time yet. I did some     tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the     differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)    [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]    Andre\\' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :    - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.      Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but     they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the     blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most     cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to     run through it\\'s event-loop again and again.    - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.      This \"Gfx Context Switching\" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,     where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed     again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching     and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will     remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the     connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).  Say What!? - - - - - -    Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:    David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :     How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs     on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your     machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the     same operation between client and server.    I\\'m not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received   the following confirmation...    Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):     I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big     difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage     and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This     helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was     essential when I only had 8 MB.    Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :     [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as     your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a     major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in     absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.    Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :     Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU\\'s are mostly idle, X\\'s     cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate     doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they     are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your     action.      The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2     cpu\\'s halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going     over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved     buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing     even fewer context switches.  ---------------------------- Other Sources of Information ----------------------------    Volume 8 in O\\'Reilly\\'s X Window System Series, ``X Window System   Administrator\\'s Guide\\'\\' is a book all X administrator\\'s should read.

       "  '  This definitely had nothing to do with the entry of the government into the support of science; some of it is relevant in technology.  There was little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of state universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII. The US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was mainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not that many research universities, but they all provided their researchers with low teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for travel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and a university wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well as salary.  During WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure scientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they  were not exactly in the areas of the scientists\\' expertise.  This is probably because of the \"research mind\" approach, which is not to try to find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution emerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to discussion about their problems, the job got done.  The military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the future, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was unwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the future supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as  NSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly keep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations, making it more difficult for them to act to support research.  The worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which the government supports research the university will not provide funding, and in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose, as has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of a graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask for one?  The answer I will get is, \"Get the money from NSF.\"  Now the money at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it comes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from getting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects get supported, and how much.    Also, the government decided that the \"wealth\" should be spread.  So instead of having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research institutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into being.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating reseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal has to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals already done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am proposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find  impossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrow I may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright idea which solves yesterday\\'s too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to something I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast,  and except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it is not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring  more than minimal attention of a good researcher.    I believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would have happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government is trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.',\n",

In the postseason, he sucked dirty canal water through a straw. The Jays won *in spite* of Morris much more than *because of* him.   Umm, Roger? Return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago, where the poster Valentine was replying to used # of WS rings as a measure of better. The concept is called \"context\", and you should really become familiar with it someday.   Unless this transaltes to \"Clemens hasn\\'t gone into Lou Gorman\\'s office with a large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he\\'d been traded to the Jays,\" I\\'m at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it.   What on earth does this mean? Over their careers, Clemens has \"won\" 68% of the games he\\'s started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17 wins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing the other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If so, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morris allows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in his career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens\\' career ERA. But I forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance to Buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had Morris been on the Sox, it would have been a routine groundout, right?   Speaking of stupid, it has been patiently (and not-so-patiently) explained to you many times that attributing greatness to players based on the accomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that a racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race. Your continued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to any of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have spent a few too many games in goal without a mask.   No one is crying; the Jays won, and as a team they certainly deserved to win at least the AL East. They performed well in two short series and won the World Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope they keep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when they traded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical link between Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man was credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runs out, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992, gave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.  Seriously, Roger, I\\'d really like to hear your explanation of the difference between the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher, and why?

After some initial problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images just fine.

       "  'April 16, 1993  INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROPOSAL  The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement on cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of millions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to robust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.  However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the National Security Agency.  The so-called \"Clipper Chip\" is an 80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents would store users\\' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be classified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for incorporation into its communications products.       This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .  First, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes. Furthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for the Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.  Second, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet, the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.    Third, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys?  Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual\\'s Fifth Amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  These are but a few of the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to answer.  In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy and security.  However, the \"Clipper Chip\" solution ought to be considered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the discussion even begins.  DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:  ESCROW  The 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom hold 40-bits of each key.  The manufacturer of the communications device would be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow agents.  A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.  Upon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  According to the Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administration have suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the Federal Reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen, but there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.  CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS  The Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which the government or others could break the code without securing keys from the escrow agents -- and that the President will be told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this, Administration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation would then be made public.  The Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source, secret contract between the National Security Agency and two private firms:  VLSI and Mycotronx.  NSA work on this plan has been underway for about four years.  The manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago.  GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER  In order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, VP Al Gore, and maybe even the President.  At today\\'s Commerce Department press briefing, a number of people asked this question, though:  why would any private organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had no independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors?  COMPREHENSIVE POLICY INQUIRY  The Administration has also announced that it is about to commence an inquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection, encryption, and law enforcement.  The items to be considered include:  export controls on encryption technology and the FBI\\'s Digital Telephony Proposal.  It appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the National Security Council.  Unfortunately, however, the Presidential Directive describing the inquiry is classified.  Some public involvement in the process has been promised, but they terms have yet to be specified.  FROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:  Jerry Berman, Executive Director (jberman@eff.org) Daniel J.

       "  ' That depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled. Radio Electronics compiles all of the cards, then each advertiser gets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers who circled their number. Some magazines also provide the data on self-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the data on computer disk.  The advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will notice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called a \"bingo card\" in the industry) includes lines for a company name and a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national advertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as best they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company and include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably send you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer call you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they will send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail outlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th e whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have nothing to mail out accept the catalog.  A couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry magazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They use the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read the magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push you, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile how many people requested which data for their marketing demographics. This way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that \"23% of readers requesting data were interested in capacitors.\" And finally, some magazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For example, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information about test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC\\'s, in the past 6 months.  The other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines include how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the advertiser can attempt to cull out the \"literature collectors\" from the serious potential customers.  \"Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could.\"  What\\'s the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?    Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more   than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of   weeks later.    If you are really, really serious and you really, really want   the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also   cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually   everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data   on a computer printout.    To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you\\'re   not really \"qualified\" for, send in a bingo card at least every   other month and circle two or three numbers.    Include a business name and phone number, even if it\\'s your house.   Advertisers almost never call. ',\n",

       "  '-*----  Far from being \"tossed out,\" the gospels are taken, almost universally, as the primary source of information about Jesus. I am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is referring.  Who \"tosses out\" the New Testament?  Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this, but the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb ascribes this more broadly.  Perhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is why, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, far outnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels *not* taken as \"gospel truth\" that faithfully records just what happened two thousand years ago?  This has an easy answer, and the answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken this way by a critical reader.  There is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text, measures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the text as \"historically valid\" or \"tosses out\" the text.  I suspect this myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and secondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority, and from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present historical arguments along these lines for their religious program.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondary school history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better such texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed above, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if it bit him on the keister twice.  Let me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts and their use in studying history.  First, all texts are historically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, I have never seen a notion of \"historical validity\" that makes any sense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read as telling the \"gospel truth\" about historical events, in the way that many students are wont to read history texts in primary and secondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favorite author\\'s history of whatever.)  Every text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by some person (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, every text can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what can we learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) does the text provide evidence?  The diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historical evidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the  vampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  The modern American history textbooks that whitewash \"great American figures\" are historical evidence.  These are all historical evidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at all that the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; that Jesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that \"great American figures\" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school. They are better evidence that some people \"saw\" the Maharishi, late of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christians thought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe \"saw\" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an educational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather than teach history.  How does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of historical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is a very complex question that has no easily summarized answer. There are many books on the subject or various parts of the subject.  I enjoy David Hackett Fischer\\'s \"Historian\\'s Fallacies\" as a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy to read texts present history.  It\\'s relatively cheap.  It\\'s easy to read.  Give it a try.',\n",

       "  \"   There was an interesting article in Scientific American some time ago about breathing liquid. (It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out.) As far as I can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid:   - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out      of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own     breathing effort (let alone anything else)    - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is     expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled     is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)     So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done     by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen     tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough     oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.    - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough     gas per unit volume.     Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs or interfere with their healing or anything like that...  \",\n",

       "  'Yarn of Cargo of Human Bones [1]     Copyright, 1924, by the New York Times Company    Special Cable to The New York Times     PARIS, Dec 22, -- Marseilles is excited by a weird story of the arrival in that port of a ship flying the British flag and named Zan carrying a mysterious cargo of 400 tons of human bones consigned to manufacturers there. The bones are said to have been loaded at Mudania on the Sea of Marmora and to be the remains of the victims of massacres in Asia Minor. In view of the rumors circulating it is expected that an inquiry will be instigated.     - - - Reference - - -  [1] _New York Times_, December 23, 1924, page 3, column 2 (bottom)     - - - - - - - - - - - -  On the 78th Commemorative Anniversary of the Turkish genocide of the Armenians, we remember those whose only crime was to be Armenian in the shadow of an  emerging Turkish proto-fascist state. In their names we demand justice.  In April 1915, the Turkish government began a systematically executed  de-population of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a  genocidal extermination. This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively ruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The  result: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen and plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilization on those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any vestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today\\'s Turkish governmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacture distortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In  the face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies  shamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy  merely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state  policy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a  crime encouraged. Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the  successful genocide of the Armenians.  Turkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians, yet... Armenians were removed from every city, town, and village in the whole of  Turkey! Armenians who resisted deportation and massacre are referred to as  \"rebels\".  Turkey claims there was no genocide of the Armenians, yet...Turkish population figures today show zero Armenians in eastern Turkey, the Armenian homeland.  Turkey claims Armenians were always a small minority, yet...Turkey claims  Armenians were a \"threat\".  In a final insult to the victims, the Republic of Turkey sold the bones of  approximately 100,000 murdered Armenians for profit to Europe.  Today, the Turkish government is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. The success of this genocide is hangs over the heads of Turkey\\'s Kurdish population.  The Armenians demand recognition, reparation, return of Armenian land and property lost as a result of this genocide.

EDT                                          THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  My voice is coming to you this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio station in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to meet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs, health care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly broadcast with the American people.                             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when it reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past seven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with the people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus tour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last year's campaign.                            Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with you, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and what I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting to you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.                            You sent me to Washington to get our government and economy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad experiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important it is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do business.                              We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations rise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness of their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the cooperative experience and spirit that exists between business, labor and government.  Although many of the economies of the industrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've made many of the smart investments and the tough choices which our government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them have been moving ahead and too many of our people have been falling behind.                            We have an economy today that even when it grows is not producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation by four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to show for it.  We know that wages of most working people have stopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks and that too many families can no longer afford the escalating cost of health care.                            But we also know that, given the right tools, the right incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and businesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy needs to expand opportunity and to make our communities better places to live.                            In many critical products today Americans are the low cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that we create more of those kinds of jobs.                            Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for long-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old priorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to be -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs and education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the waste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious resources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the groundwork for robust economic growth in the future.                            These new directions passed the Congress in record time and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our country.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would create hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private sector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It now has the support of a majority of the United States Senate.  But it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the Senate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know would result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.                            The issue isn't politics; the issue is people.  Millions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and counting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill has been grounded by gridlock.                              I know the American people are tired of business as usual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin or wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have taken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra mile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25 percent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.                              It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million Americans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill languish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean hundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to act to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking this initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I think we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant portion of our original goals.                            First, we want to keep the programs as much as possible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs, including highway and road construction, summer jobs for young people, immunization for children, construction of waste water sites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding for extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who have been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't creating jobs.                            Second, I've recommended that all the other programs in the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40 percent.                            And third, I've recommended a new element in this program to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against crime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire police officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put them back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight for a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it and deserve it.                            Now, the people who are filibustering this bill -- the Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it increases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this year that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable, doesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more than paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this budget is well within the spending limits already approved by the Congress this year.                            It's amazing to me that many of these same senators who are filibustering the bill voted during the previous administration for billions of dollars of the same kind of emergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the American people to work.                              This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered a plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities are -- on people or on politics.                              Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar for dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the soundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our children.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs and investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of us when we've helped make more American partners working to ensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.                            You know, if every American who wanted a job had one, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this country today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first step to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country again.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid for over the life of our budget.                            Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how important the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.                            Good morning, and thank you for listening.\",\n",

       "  '        Mr. Parsli, I have to take exception at this.  There are verifiable, previous *examples* of levels of U.S. governments abusing gun-control restrictions.  I don\\'t think it is paranoid to worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused in thye future.  After so many times of getting burned any sane person will stop putting his hand on the stove.          I\\'d love to.  But as long as the politicians grab power to sell pork back to their constituents, there\\'s not a lot I can do.           It\\'s silly to suggest that if there\\'s anything we can\\'t trust the government to do, and therefore the government should be allowed to do it, then we should change governments.  Down that road lies total government power.   I\\'ve never been a fan of totalitarianism.          This is very likely.          The North American Continent is not Europe, no matter how many people would like it to be.  Drugs are very illegal and they\\'re here.  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control.  If it is necessary to control guns over the whole continent, then Canada should have always had comparable rates to the U.S., yet they still don\\'t. Unless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more magical than the Mexican border (which is shorter and far more heavily patrolled) then I really can\\'t accept that argument.          No, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S., two-thirds of which are suicides.  (Unfortunately I don\\'t have suicide rates for Norway.)  However, this makes the per-gun death rate about half the per-car death rate.         The problem\\'s been humans since before we had stone axes.  The fct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody, whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally irrelevent.        Yet weapons are *built*.  I\\'d suggest, then, that the murderous impulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.        Anyway, the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt to kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns, even if we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.           In the U.S., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms. (50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns, per  se, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe\\'s countries *entire* violent crime rate.  I don\\'t really think we\\'ve got more knives or fists.           In any case, I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S. have been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms of prohibition.  Until you deal with *why* people are doing what they are doing, you won\\'t solve your problem.  And if the problem is  violent crime, you shouldn\\'t concentrate on the tools instead.  The *vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (On the order of 99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  This says to me that you can\\'t make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.          The situation is not \"good\" in that people fear for their lives. But recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots, protecting their shops with guns.  Would it have been better they, too, lost their livelihoods?          The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles, no it isn\\'t. However, if that problem becomes a violent action, then yes, it can be appropriate.  Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition won\\'t make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it.         You have to examine which problem you\\'re referring to.  If you\\'re discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it is a perfectly legitimate response to make them stop.  (Hopefully simply letting them know you\\'re prepared to shoot them would be enough, as it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.)          45% of Households have some form of firearm, usually a long gun. That accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans. Firearm ownership is most likely among educated, well-off whites, the group *least* likely to be involved in violent crime.         You may take that for what it\\'s worth. ',\n",

While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their    highest court \"Supreme Court,\" \"Supreme Judicial Court\" or \"Supreme    Court of Appeals,\" Maryland and New York call theirs simply the    \"Court of Appeals.\"  To make matters worse, New York also calls its    _second-highest_ court the \"Supreme Court, Appellate Division\"...  Atlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)):  Oscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company\\'s plant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as to which came first, the plaintiff\\'s acquisition of the land or he defendant\\'s start of production at their cement plant.)  In the course of its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the plaintiffs\\' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the plant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked the court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.  (Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al owned their property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it. Atlantic Cement\\'s actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)  Instead of granting the plaintiffs\\' request for an injunction, the court ordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided that Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  In other words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, the power and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment of their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain is always problematical even when it\\'s done by the state; allowing a private firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.  (Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn\\'t call it eminent domain.  But if it walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks like eminent domain...)  Let me take issue with the way you\\'ve presented the case... you say that \"What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn\\'t allow the plaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million dollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages.\"  Blackmail?      (Pulls out Black\\'s Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....     \"Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to     do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose     disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under     extortion statutes.\")  How do you define as \"blackmail\" one party\\'s act of demanding the right to set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns and which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or of demanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I see it, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of owning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to stay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price they wanted.  There isn\\'t, or at least shouldn\\'t be, any law that says that you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.  You go on to say: \"The plant would never have been shut down -- the plaintiff\\'s lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement, because the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K to having the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less than the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation.\"  If so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the business of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from other parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those other parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn\\'t want to have to face a choice between paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well, shouldn\\'t Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_ business?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_ the parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was Atlantic Cement\\'s own fault for choosing to build and operate the type of plant they did where and when they did.)  And then you say: \"Everyone\\'s property rights were protected; the plaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided.\" As above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were \"made whole.\" They were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners of property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price acceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ made whole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the business of ensuring that \"unnecessary\" settlement costs are avoided? (If so, I\\'ve been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)   (1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as \"infamous,\" at least not at my school.  (Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for their first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I first encountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal opinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students get into their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick and choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory Professional Responsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly and self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously intimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly biased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors tend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This is especially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are practicing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_ educational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat cloistered scholar.  End of aside.)  I called it infamous because that\\'s my opinion of it.  For the reasons I\\'ve stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can only call \"economic correctness\" over justice.  (2) It is \"completely sensible\" only if you believe that the alleged right of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and the alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to not have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who own property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement\\'s wrongful acts. (And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other branch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take other people\\'s property by eminent domain.)   Really?  I didn\\'t know that... what, if anything, has he had to say about cases like _Boomer_?   I\\'ve admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to as \"law and economics\" is weak.  If it advocates the use of economical analysis as one of many \"tie-breaker\" factors which courts may use to help them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured by the scale of \"justice\", is evenly balanced, fine.  But as illustrated by _Boomer_, it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economics of a case as being more important than the justice of a case.',\n",

Such a charge seems to imply that no reasonable person would ever conclude from the verse that Paul intended to condemn homosexuality; however, I think I can see how a reasonable person might very well take this view of the verse.

Clarke  Krieger Publishing Company Melbourne, Florida, USA Orig. Ed. 1993 Pre-publication $84.50 ISBN 0-89464-039-9   This text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a technological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the space betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the tlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make such a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized that there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to reach them.     Tracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient, attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of technology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel became feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed than ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that matter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason as the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate reflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and knowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as well as selected events important in developing the idea of extraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological entries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and speculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between simultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal connections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every entry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every spacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This allows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize differences, similarities, and influences.  This text will be of interest to students of astronautical history, and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic diagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and historians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The unique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and very interesting history of the spaceship.  SPECIAL FEATURES  Includes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and fictional  Contains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos contemporary with the subject.  This includes extremely rare illustrations from scarce books and novels, exclusive photos and drawings fromSoviet spacecraft; rare stills from both famous and obscure science fiction films, and unpublished photographs from NASA archives  An index, bibliography, and appendices are included.

The 51 day standoff between federal agents and the Branch Davidians ended on April 19 in what appeared to be a mass suicide by fire.  Now that the multi-million dollar standoff is over, a few things remain: cleaning up the mess, and assigning blame.  \\\\  From the onset of the April 19 tear gas attacks by federal agents, President Clinton already started passing the buck by saying ``Talk to the attorney general or the FBI... I knew it was going to be done, but the decision was {\\\\it entirely theirs}.  {\\\\it They} made the tactical decision.'' Enter Attorney General Janet Reno.  After most of the Branch Davidians died, Reno said she took ``full responsibility'' for the decision.  ``I approved the plan'' she said adding that she ``did not advise him [Clinton] as to the details.''  In fact, she told Clinton that it was ``the best way to go.'' As the fire was roaring through the Branch Davidian's compound Clinton said that he was ``deeply sadened by the loss of life'' and in the same breath that ``the law enforcement agencies involved in the Waco siege recommended the course of action pursued today.''  Later he went on to say ``I stand by that [Reno's] decision.''  \\\\  How did this all begin?  At 0930 on February 28 agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) launched a full-scale, high-profile assault on the Branch Davidian's compound.  This raid was much more than an assault on a group suspected of possessing illegal weapons.  The assault was a planned media circus used as a propaganda device of the BATF to show their might and just purpose.  \\\\  At the onset of the ``no-knock'' raid, gaggles of heavily armed BATF agents made their way inside the compound without identifying themselves or state that they had a warrant until long after the shooting began. Silently, the agents made their way to the compound's buildings and started their ``search'' by charging at the buildings and throwing concussion grenades and ordering the cult members to come out of the buildings.  \\\\  If unknown persons dressed in black ninja costumes and combat fatigues were to attack you, throwing grenades and brandishing firearms, would you not assume that these people are criminals and attempt to defend yourself?  The tactics employed by the BATF provoked the battle.  \\\\  The initial assualt by the BATF was not successful.  Unfortunately, lives were lost on both sides.  But, had the assault been a success, the liberal media would have praised the BATF by showing the footage of BATF agents carting away a bunch of gun-wielding religious nuts.  Of course, any violation of the cult's rights would have been overlooked and the media would proclaim America's fortune in having super-cop organizations like the BATF that can systematically ``take out'' terroristic groups such as the Branch Davidians.  \\\\  As far as I can see, the BATF and the FBI dropped the ball - just like Philadelphia did in the 1985 MOVE crisis which left 11 dead, 250 homeless, and a city block razed. It appears that the BATF has adopted the shoot-first tactic of no-knock raids to execute search warrants.  Don't let the BATF convince you that the no-knock raid was justified.  No-knock assaults make sense when looking for, say, drugs that can easily be hidden or disposed of in a few seconds. The BATF was looking for illegal weapons, not drugs that could be hidden or flushed down the toilet in a matter of a few seconds.  What ever happened to ``This is the police!  You are surrounded...''?  {\\\\it This policy of no-knock raids, by federal and local agencies, should be restricted}.  Further, the use of military firepower against presumed innocent citizens is a very scary idea, and is why the Davidians were justified in using lethal force to ensure that their fourth ammendment rights [``the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures''] are not denied.  \\\\  \\\\  \\\\  \\\\noindent Matthew L.

There is a boom that comes from the side on which the device is mounted so that it is positioned in front of the user's eye.  The Private Eye we had here for evaluation was Hercules-MDA compatible.  The innards are a row (~400 LEDs) that are swept up and down by a galvonometer-like movement.  The result is that the sweeping LED bar forms a fused raster.

       "  \"  Paul's statement only asserts that that particular choice was not a matter of karmic fulfillment of the past, just as the fate of the man born blind (John 9) was not.  There is no question here of the simplistic idea of karma as a machine that is the sole determiner of one's destiny.  Even the eastern traditions, or many of them, do not say that, as one knowledgeable poster pointed out.  And if in fact that Paul did not know about or believe in reincarnation does not say anything one way or another about it.  Even John the Baptist, who Jesus says emphatically is Elijah (Matt 11:14), does not appear to  have been aware of it, at least at the point at which he was asked. But  it is interesting that his threefold denial -- to the question whether  he is the Christ, the Prophet (i.e. Isaiah), or Elijah, is emphatic in  the first case and very weak in the third.  I would like to add once again that, while it is important to discuss the different passages that may point directly to the teaching of repeated earth lives, one way or another, what I really see as important in our time is that the subject be revisited in terms of the larger view of Christianity and Christian doctrine.  For the most part, those who do accept it either reject the central ideas of Christianity or, if they are Christians, hold their conviction as a kind of separate treasure. I believe that Christianity has important new understanding to bring to bear on it, and vice versa, much that is central to Christianity takes on entirely new dimensions of meaning in light of repeated earth lives. It has a direct bearing on many of the issues frequently discussed  in this newsgroup in particular.  I have said openly that I have developed my views of repeated earth lives largely from the work of Rudolf Steiner.  Not that I hold him as an authority, but the whole picture of Christianity becomes clearer in light of these ideas.  Steiner indicated that the old consciousness of reincar- nation necessarily had to fade away that it could be renewed in later times, after a time of development of the Christ idea through the first two millenia after Christ's deed on Golgotha.  In our own time, it becomes  important that, having received the basic gospel of salvation, our  understanding of life and of the human being can now grow to embrace the  significance of this idea.  For the discussions in this newsgroup, I  have tried to focus on that which can be related as directly as possible  to scripture and to fundamental Christian teaching and tradition.\",\n",

       "  \"     Many pagans are involved in environmentalism--this is only natural, since respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations.  This doesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.    Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like it or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be, and isn't.     I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has forgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we have something to learn from the pagan movement.   First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of oppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to live in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ  could have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great deal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the  male-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.   Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great ramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings and our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress and deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.   Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism is an attractive option.   I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.) should be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of sexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated sexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.\",\n",

Its easy enough to convert, but if I don't know which way they are stored, I dont know  which direction the polygon should be visible from.

It is actually a response from my Aunt, who has 5 kids, since I have none yet.       I\\'m posting this for a good Christian relative who does not have e-mail access.  Since this aunt and uncle have 5 kids I felt they would be more relevant than I, who have none (yet).       13-year-old (13YO) twins, 10YO boy, 6.5YO boy, 2YO girl       I don\\'t call it spanking, but they do, so yes, very rarely.       I don\\'t call it spanking because it\\'s more of a reaction to something very dangerous, such as trying to stick their finger in a fan or running into the road.  Maybe 3-4 times for each except for the 2YO girl, who has not been spanked yet.      They call it that because it *does* hurt their feelings, and of course I give all the hugs and stuff to ensure they know they\\'re still loved.       No, that would be too painful.  If it\\'s too traumatic they never recall why they were punished.  Besides, it must be immediate, and taking the time to go get a toolmeans you\\'re not doing it right away, and that lessens the impact.  It\\'s very emotional for a child as it is - which is evidenced by the fact that a little slap on the rear - which hurts for perhaps 5 seconds - is called a spanking.      Lots of logical consequences - for instance, when 4YO Matthew dared a good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out, I made sure they didn\\'t play together for 5 days so he\\'d know that would make him lose friends very quickly.  He\\'s never done anything like that since.      We also use time-out in their rooms - I use a timer so they don\\'t keep arguing with me over leaving, since it\\'s hard to argue with a macine. I will go to the closed door and tell them timeout won\\'t be over until they calm down if they\\'re too tantrumy.  I use the top of the stairs when they\\'re really young.       40       Bath, Ohio.  It\\'s right outside of Akron, in the northeast part of Ohio.       No, and none of my kids would dream of it.  I hope you can use this to teach all parents that physical punishment isn\\'t always required - parents use that as an excuse to hit too hard.       Lots of timeouts, same as I use.  Our family and my husband\\'s have never used spankings.  In fact, my grandmother in law was one of 11 kids, and they were almost never spanked.  This was around the turn of the century.  And, none of us has ever been afoul of the law - man-made or God\\'s law.      Jesus says, referring to a small child whom he is holding, that \"what ye do to the least of these, ye do also to me.\"  The Bible also says in all things to be kind, and merciful, and especially loving. (Colossians 3:12-15.) There is no room for selfish anger, which I\\'ll admit I\\'ve been tempted with at times.  When I\\'ve felt like spanking hard in anger, maybe the kid deserved a little slap on the rear, but what I would have given would have been the devil\\'s work.  I could feel the temptation, and just angrily ordered the kid to his/her room and went to my room myself.  After praying and asking God\\'s forgiveness, I was much calmer, and did not feel like spanking, but felt that what I had done was enough punishment.',\n",
       "  ' (excerpts from posting on this topic)    (I\\'ve seen satellites at midnight - they\\'re not only in twilight.) :o)    Now my comments:   I\\'d like to add that some of the \"protests\" do not come from a strictly  practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for  research activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I  would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may  never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred -  unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars  as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and  a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time  - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man.  Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.   Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there  and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief  in an afterlife.    The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks  and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light  crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people  is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating  the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or  thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.   But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky.   Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live  in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport  currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The  impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists  that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped  into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life  forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels  (or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains  one weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing,  malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed  the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80  miles to the east.  (Their \\'security light\\' didn\\'t help matters  much either.)  But I\\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of  high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect.   But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\\'t  fouled in some way.  (I mean they\\'ve been TRYING this forever -  like, concerning Tesla\\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\\'t watch  commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer,  truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.   If ya\\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at  least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.    To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage  of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at  8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the  local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\\'ll be trying to see it  if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could  be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky  while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that  as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid,  even if it can\\'t ever be perfectly achieved. ',\n",

       "  ' Hindsight\\'s 20-20. Nobody expected Kisio to have his 2nd best career year.   I didn\\'t mean to imply that Gund\\'s offer wasn\\'t enough.  Gund\\'s offer was the right $, but too late in the season.  $2M offered in November lets Sather buy a replacement for Murphy *this* season and make the playoffs *this* year. $2M in March doesn\\'t help Sather with his immediate objectives, doesn\\'t help with long term objectives (only a prospect or draft pick does, and no way should the Sharks do that). However, getting back to what-if games, had Kisio been traded to Chicago last year, then the Sharks go 0 for October, and maybe Gund panicks sooner in November. And here\\'s another what-if twist: Chicago would have had Kisio this season; they *never* go after Murphy in the first place because Kelly is having his *best* season (bigger guys in Chicago). So Gund has no competition. So Ferriera, Sather, and Keenan all look like geniuses.  A broken fax machine, and Ferriera, Keenan, and maybe Kingston (and maybe even Green) lose their jobs.

       "  ' I recently watched a an episode of \"The Old West\" a TV show on the  Discovery Channel (or perhaps the A&E Network), the one hosted by Kenny Rogers.  This episode was all about the Mormons and how they settled Utah, etc.  A large portion of the broadcast was about the \"Mountain Meadows Massacre\". The program very specifically pointed out that Brigham Young knew nothing about the incident until long after it had happened (before telegraph), and it occured as a result of several men inciting a bunch of paronoid Moromn settlers into what amounted to a mob.  All participants in the incident were prosecuted and eccomunicated from the LDS Church.  I suggest you watch a rerun of that episode (they play them over and over)  and see what they (non-Mormons) have to say about it.   Lance   ',\n",
       "  'In the Monday, May 10 morning edition of the San Jose Mercury News an article by Sandra Gonzales at the top of page 12A explained convicted killer David Edwin Mason\\'s troubled childhood saying,   \"Raised in Oakland and San Lorenzo by strict fundamentalist  Christian parents, Mason was beaten as a child.  He once was  tied to a workbench and gagged with a cloth after he accidently  urinated on his mother when she walked under his bedroom window,  court records show.\"  Were the San Jose Mercury news to come out with an article starting with \"Raised in Oakland by Mexican parents, Mason was beaten...\", my face would be red with anger over the injustice done to my Mexican family members and the Mexican community as a whole.  I\\'m sure Sandra Gonzales would be equally upset.  Why is it that open biggotry like this is practiced and encouraged by the San Jose Mercury News when it is pointed at the christian community?  Can a good christian continue to purchase newspapers and buy advertising in this kind of a newspaper?  This is really bad journalism.',\n",
       "  'Folks,  It\\'s time to start building some precise questions to send to our federal elected officials and to investigative reporters in our local TV, radio and newprint media.  Ideally, these questions could be asked at any investigation into the BATF\\'s and FBI\\'s participation at the WACO fiasco in hopes of being resolved and, hopefully, wake up the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth from the BATF and FBI.  My list is up to 13 that are really nagging  at my gut.  The list will probably grow.   1.   What were the contents of the original warrant, now sealed, that      the BATF obtained?  2.   It is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and/or ammunition      could not be flushed down the toilet.  Therefore, a \"no-knock\"      raid could be ruled out.  Prior to the initial assault on the       complex, did a single BATF agent and accompanying witness (without       a contingent of assault and news media personnel) attempt to knock       on the door of the Branch Davidian\\'s complex and serve the warrant       in a manner prescribed by law?  3.   On the day of the initial assault on the complex, BATF agents      were aware that several small children were inside the buildings.      In the ensueing gun battle, BATF agents fired into a building      known to contain children, killing at least one two-year old child.      Knowing children were present, why didn\\'t the BATF have an      alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to      the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening      fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building?   4.   The FBI spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that      David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians possessed over      $200,000 in firearms and ammunition.  Did David Koresh and the      members of the Branch Davidians have a valid Federal Firearms      License, were they actively participating in the legal business      of selling/buying firearms and ammunition, and were any of the      weapons they had illegally possessed?  Does this paper evidence      consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally      dispossessed weapons.  5.   After the original assault on the compound tragically failed,      a BATF spokeswoman stated \"We were outgunned!\".  Yet, TV newscasts      of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show BATF agents      armed with MP-5 and AR-15/M16 rifles.  Although unclear on the      video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent\\'s      bodies, they also may have had AK-47 and SKS rifles.  What type(s)      of firearms did the BATF agents have immediate access to at the       scene of the original assault on the complex?  6.   Since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the      complex involuntarily, why did the FBI treat it as a \"hostage\"      situation?   7.   Along the same lines, why did the FBI use \"psychological warfare\"      techniques, including sensory overload, sleep deprivation, and      other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any       normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the       complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind?  8.   Reports indicate several of the children inside the complex      were accompanied by their mothers.  Since it is reasonable      to expect these mothers would have their children taken away      from them if they came out, why did the FBI expect the mothers      to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities?  9.   Agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the Branch      Davidians setting fire to the complex.  Branch Davidian members      who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an       armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a       lantern which was setting on a table.  Video tape of the incident       does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the       fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location.        Was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle       penetrated?  10.  FBI spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the David Koresh and      the members of the Branch Davidians committed mass suicide.  Yet,      bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas      within the building complex.  This seems to be counter to any      known mass suicides through history.  What evidence does the FBI      have that a mass suicide pact existed?  11.  FBI Director Sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on      the video tape was caused by the Branch Davidian\\'s ammunition      and/or powder cache exploding.  Yet, the fireball seems to be      more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas      or other highly volatile fuel source explodes.  Was any evidence       found which would indicate the Branch Davidians had an ammunition       and/or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball?  If so,      and if David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians were       engaged in the legal business of selling/buying firearms, was the      amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect      for someone engaged in such a legal business?  12.  It is rumored that one FBI agent was extremely upset about critical      news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to      crush a reporter\\'s car which had been left at the compound.  Is       there any factual basis to this rumor and, if so, what charges will       be brought against the FBI agent who performed the act?  13.  FBI Director Sessions states that, during the final assault on the      complex, \"over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles.\"  On the video      tape of the incident, you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles      engines.  Yet, there is no sound of the sharp reports that one      would expect to hear if shots were fired.  Also, there are no       indications of smoke and/or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows,      buildings or other structures in the video.  Surely, these should be       evident if the Branch Davidians had fired on the armored vehicles.        Finally, the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter,       sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be       apparent if the Branch Davidians had fired upon the vehicles.  Do       any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas       into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by       shots from high-power rifles?  14.  CS gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent.  The United      States has signed international treaties which prevent the use      of CS gas in warfare.  If the United States could not morally use      CS gas against Saddam Hussein and his troops, why is it morally      acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land?  15.  On April 21, FBI spokesmen state that at least 3 bodies discovered      in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had      been murdered or had committed suicide.  On April 22, the county      coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet      wounds to the head.  Were any of the victims bodies found within      the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head?',\n",

In retrospect, I can see how the sightseeing thing would be offensive to many.  I originally saw it just as poetic license, but it's understandable that others might see it differently.  I still think that Ken came on a bit strong though.  I also think that your advice to Masud Khan:    #Before you argue with someone like Mr Arromdee, it's a good idea to   #do a little homework, or at least think.  was unnecessary.   Throughout all your articles in this thread there is the tacit assumption that the original poster was exhibiting casual anti-semitism.  If I agreed with that, then maybe your speech on why this is bad might have been relevant.  But I think you're reading a lot into one flip sentence.  While probably not true in this case, too often the charge of anti-semitism gets thrown around in order to stifle legitimate criticism of the state of Israel.

The same material is used in the cryogenics industrya and marine industries as a structural material and is called G-10.  FR-4 and G-10 are both green.  They are not green because of a solder masking agent.  The basic ingredients are a clear epoxy resin and glass fibers.  I am not sure what the specs are on the resin, but if you are really curious you can call NEMA (National Electronics Manufacturing Association) or Ciba Geigy (a major manufacturer of epoxy resins) to find out.

I don\\'t particularly want this discussion to spark a lengthy debate, but I do think it\\'s worth pointing out that \"popular usage\" is not always sufficient excuse.    In this case, for example, I think an appropriate parallel may be found in the pronunciation of proper names: if people commonly misspelled or  mispronounced your name, would you feel compelled to change it?  Probably not.    The same is true of X.  \"The X Window System\", \"X\", \"X11\", and related monickers are proper names in the same sense that any product name is a proper name.  In fact, some of them are *trademarked* names.  The fact  that many people get them wrong is largely beside the point.    As for the trade publications that promulgate things like \"X Window\" or \"X.windows\" or any of the other nonsensical variants one often sees,  consider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by  *journalists*.  Would you trust the facts of a journalist who couldn\\'t be bothered to get the name of his/her source right?  Would you trust a product review by someone who got the name of the product wrong?

Only our level of trust is affected, not the security of the system.  The algorithm *could* be RSA for all we know, which we believe to be secure.  They have a much better reason to classify the algorithm than to protect its security.  They want to protect its market share.  If they publish the algorithm, then shortly manufacturers would make chips that implement the algorithm and standard but do not use a key stored in escrow.  And of course, everybody would buy them.   The whole push of this chip is that by establishing a standard that you can only use if you follow their rules, they get us to follow their rules without enacting new laws that we would fight tooth and nail.

       "  'DS>From: viking@iastate.edu (Dan Sorenson)   DS>>Riding up the hill leading to my DS>>house, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to DS>>the Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to DS>>the Spagthorpe Viking).  DS>        I must have missed the article on the Spagthorpe Viking.  Was DS>that the one with the little illuminated Dragon\\'s Head on the front DS>fender, a style later copied by Indian, and the round side covers?  No. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when (forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing. The first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max Friz\\'s famous design, but with an overhead \"point cam\" (see below for more on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground clearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so that the ground clearance was substantially increased:         ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)                  Viking motor (front) ->   \\\\=@=/  This is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved around a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn in the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting rods to accomodate the stroke.  The engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still unique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and and extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was required to drive both overhead valves.  Just as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a pressurized stream of oil to power the \"waterwheel\" which kept the lobe spinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal engineering fixes was that until the engine\\'s oil pressure came up to normal, the engine\\'s valve timing would be more or less random, resulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a little hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the beast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to pressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however, uses an electric oil pump. Wimps).  Despite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively firing its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily lose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even higher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This was feasible because it was a racing engine.  With just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers because of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an almost perfect point:                      /\\\\                    /()\\\\   <-lobe                   / XX \\\\  <-complex linkage (not shown due to  valvestems ->   / \\\\  / \\\\    complexity)                 |  |   | |                 |  |===| |                     =0=  <---piston                      |                              Note that the tip was not truly vertical                              (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the                              ground, and this drawing doesn\\'t show the                              curvature because there was none in the                              head itself. The bore curve would start                              about where the cylinder bore disappears in                              this diagram   The effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of the day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of finned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. Thus, the name.  The Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it worked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary technology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized that racing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machines were raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate (approximately six Vikings were made, plus one or possibly two Springers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and down that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many as twenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. However, no modern record of a production Viking has survived, and most motorcycle historians discount this story.

       "  \" OK, as one last attempt, I'll take a different tack.  We all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why one can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is, is one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of us who have bikes are familiar.  Let's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its own, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to get rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches to transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to remain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike, through suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the same way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along  a dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change  surfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact  patches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It  probably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice,  but we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like  because, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a  better way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch forces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface. You'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it was the rotation that did it.  Looking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple. Now we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and direction of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them about the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels. How it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking for something that has contact patches that can go straight and not sideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski or skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged like a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels. I think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like that, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect. Now I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try one of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in a bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very much like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn. So we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's, a similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have countersteering.  Conclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have motorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what real effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations of how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm  willing to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering.   If you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's behaviour is consistent with it. If someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.\",\n",

       "  ' Indeed, the immediate context [NASB] is:    26 Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer often   since the foundation of the world; but now once at   the consummation He has been manifested to put away    sin by the sacrifice of Himself.    27 And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die   once, and after this comes judgement;    28 so Christ also, having been offered once to bear   the sins of many, shall appear a second time, not to   bear sin, tro those who eagerly await him.   The first point is that this verse is part of an even larger context, the subject of which is not the destiny of the individual human soul but rather the singular nature of Christ\\'s sacrifice, \"once\", and the fulfillment of the law for all of fallen  mankind.  Rudolf Frieling elaborates this in detail in his  \"Christianity and Reincarnation\".  The thrust of the passage in its context is to liken the one time incarnation and  sacrifice of Christ for all mankind to the individual  experience of the human being after death.  The \"once\"  is repeated and emphasized, and it highlights the singularity  of Christ\\'s deed.  One thing for certain it does is to  refute the claims of some that Christ incarnates more than  once.  But the comparison to the human experience - die  once, then judgement (note: not \"the judgement\", but just  \"judgement\".  The word for judgement is \"krisis\".  Hebrews 9:27 is the one passage most often quoted in defense of the doctrine that the Bible denies reincarnation.  At this point, I would just emphasize again that the  passages  that (arguably) speak against it are few, and that invariably they are talking about something eles, and the apparent denial of reincarnation is either inferred, or, as in the case of Hebrews, taken literally and deposited into an implied context, namely a doctrine of the destiny of the human being after death.  What should be considered seriously is that the Bible is essentially silent about the fate of the individual human being between death and the Last Day.  If you take the few passages that could possibly be interpreted to mean a single earth life, they are arguable.  And there are other passages that point, arguably, in the other direc- tion. such as Matthew 11:14 and John 9:2.  We can continue to debate the individual scraps of scripture that might have a bearinig on this, and indeed we should discuss them. But what I wanted to introduce into the discussion was an approach to the idea of repeated earth lives that, unlike Hindu, Buddhist and \"new age\" teachings, takes full cognizance of the divinity, singular incarnation, death, burial, resurrection, and second coming of Christ as the savior of mankind; the accountability of each individual for his deeds and the reality of the Fall and of sin and its consequences; the redemption of man from sin through Christ; the resurrection of the body, and the Last Judgement.  Taken in this larger sense, many serious questions take on an entirely different perspective.  E.g. the destiny of those who died in their sins before Christ came. the relationship of faith and grace to  works, the meaning of \"deathbed conversion\", the meaning of the sacraments, and many other things.  Not that I propose to answer all those questions by a simple doctrine of convenience, but only that the discussion takes on a different dimension, and in my opinion one that is truly worthy of both man, the earth, and their Creator and  Redeemer. There are many deep questions that continue to be deep, such  as the meaning of the second death, and how the whole of Christian doctrine would apply to this larger perspective of human existence.  There are those who deeply believe that the things of which the Bible  does not speak are not things we should be concerned with.  But Christ also indicated that there were other things that we would come to know in the future, including things that his disciples (and therefore others)  could not bear yet.  This idea that the human capacity for growth in knowledge, not only of the individual in one lifetime, but of the whole of humanity, also takes on great meaning when we realize that our growth in the spirit is a long term process.  The Bible was not meant to codify all spiritual knowledge in one place forever, but to proclaim the gospel of the incarnation and redeeming deed of Christ - taking the gospel in the greater context, from Genesis to Revelation.  Now, salvation (healing) becomes,  not the end of man\\'s sojourn but its beginning.  And the Last Judgement and the New Heaven and Earth that follow it become its fulfullment.',\n",

Gillow, who had  secretly  studied the innermost workings of the Vatican since returning from Vietnam in a wheel chair, first approached the scientific community with his  theory in the late 1950\\'s.  \"The  whole hat  thing, that was just a cover  up. The  Vatican didn\\'t want the Catholic Community(tm) to realize  their  leader  was hefting nearly  8 kilograms of extraneous  bone  tissue on    the  top of  his skull.\", notes Gillow in his report. \"There are whole  laboratories in the  Vatican  that experiment with tissue  transplants and bone marrow experiments.  What started as a genetic fluke in the mid 1400\\'s is now scientifically engineered and bred for. The whole bone transplant idea started  in  the  mid   sixties  inspired  by   doctor  Timothy  Leary transplanting deer  bone cells into small white rats.\" Gillow is quick to point  out  the  assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II and the disappearance of Dr.  Leary from the public eye.  \"When it becomes time to replace the pope\", says Gillow, \"The old pope and the replacement pope are  locked  in a padded  chamber.

       "  \" Here's something I posted about this a few years ago.  It's not fully up to date with all the new variations (some of which are just different manufacturer's synonyms):  ------ In practical terms, ignoring the technological details, this is my view of the families (NB I am not a giant corporation, which influences my views on things like availability and backward compatibility):  74 The original.  Speed good, power consumption fair.  Effectively  obsolete now; use 74LS or later, except for a *very* few oddball  functions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families.  74H Modification of 74 for higher speed, at the cost of higher  power consumption.  Very obsolete; use 74F.  74L Modification of 74 for lower power, at the cost of lower speed.  Very obsolete; use CMOS.  74S Later modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in  power consumption.  Effectively obsolete; use 74F.  74LS Combination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lower  power consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of  devices.  74F Fast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high  speed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.  74AS Failed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things  that are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.  74ALS Possible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly  new, availability and prices possibly a problem.  74C Fairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with  4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer  CMOS 74 families.  4000 (Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS  family, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low  power consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.  Very forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,  but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).  There are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The  clear choice when speed is not important.  74HC A new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power  consumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for  general-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.  CMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of  supply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power  consumption at faster speeds.  74HCT 74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read  the fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility  in CMOS involves some compromises.  10K (Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources  claim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for  serious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow  the rules or it won't work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,  can be expensive.  100K (For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and  inconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.  As for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and 74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices you can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just have to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible with the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of hassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using. 10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.  Me?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are interesting but I haven't used either significantly yet.\",\n",
       "  ' Golly, I love stupid people. :-) Listen, Rex, this is hockey.  The NHL, to be precise.  And in the NHL, there exist these things called \"ties\".  A tie occurs when a game ends with the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie.  There also exits these things called \"wins\".  A win is when one team has a higher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other at a time, so I can say \"the opponent\".)  A team gets two points for a win.  So, let\\'s say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10 ties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The first team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86 points.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number of wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That\\'s amazing.  So, Rex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then that\\'s what it means.  In our example, the second team would win the tiebreaker and therefore have the \"better\" record, even though both teams had the same number of points.  If you didn\\'t understand this post, Rex, maybe you should go back and read it again, very slowly. :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)  --     Keith Keller    LET\\'S GO RANGERS!!!!!

Would you rather have someone love : you because you made them love you, or because they wanted to : love you.     The responsibility is on you to love God and take a step toward : Him.  He promises to be there for you, but you have to look for yourself.  Indeed, \"knock and it shall be opened to you\". Dan, why didn\\'t this work? I firmly believed in god for 15 years, but I eventually realised I was only deluding myself, fearful to face the truth. Ultimately, the only reason what kept me believing was the fear of hell. The mental states I  had sillily attributed to divine forces or devil\\'s attempts to  destroy my faith were nothing more than my imagination, and it is easy to achieve the same mental states at will.   My faith was just learned fear in a disguise.  : Those who doubt this or dispute it have not givin it a sincere effort.  God is demanding too much. Dan, what was it I believed in for 15 years? If sincere effort is equivalent to active suspension of disbelief - what it was in my case - I\\'d rather quit. If god does not help me to keep the faith, I can\\'t go on.   Besides, I am concerned with god\\'s morality and mental health. Does she really want us to _believe_ in herself without any help (revelations, guidance, or anything I can feel)? If she has created us, why didn\\'t she make the task any easier? Why are we supposed to love someone who refuses to communicate with us? What is the point of eternal torture for those who can\\'t believe?  I love god just as much as she loves me. If she wants to seduce me, she\\'ll know what to do.   : Simple logic arguments are folly.  If you read the Bible you will see : that Jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with \"logic\". : Our ability to reason is just a spec of creation.  Yet some think it is : the ultimate.  If you rely simply on your reason then you will never : know more than you do now.   Your argument is of the type \"you\\'ll know once you try\". Yet there are many atheists who have sincerely tried, and believed for many years, but were eventually honest enough to admit that  they had lived in a virtual reality.  What else but reason I can use? I don\\'t have the spiritual means  Christians often refer to. My conscience disagrees with the Bible. I don\\'t even believe I have a soul. I am fully dependent on my body - indeed, I _am_ this body. When it goes up with flames, so does my identity.

That is, that you make empirical observations, form an hypothesis and test it.  Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than  \"the old Newtonian model of the world\".  And I doubt that many psychologists would appreciate being put outside this empirical \"world view\".  Psychology also has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending.    Oversimplified, of course, but a good example.  This is an empirical observa- tion.  It was then tested, though perhaps not by Aristotle, and eventually  found wanting.

       "  'The article that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993 issue of USA Today (\"Drug Use Up At Younger Age\" by Mike Snider, p. 1A).      Drug use is on the rise among kids as young as eighth graders -     usually 13 - and they\\'re using more LSD and inhalants like glue     and air fresheners, says a new survey.      The annual National High School Senior Survey on Drug Abuse finds     \"statistically significant increases\" in eighth-graders\\' use of     many drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, crack, LSD and inhalants.      \"We may be in danger of losing some ... hard-won ground (in reducing     drug use) as a new, more naive generation of youngsters enters     adolescence,\" says Lloyd Johnston, University of Michigan, chief     researcher on the study sponsored by the Department of Health and     Human Services.      But drug use among high school seniors is continuing a decade-long     decline.      The study of 50,000 students shows the percentage who tried the     following in the 30 days before they were polled:          * 8th-graders  - alcohol 26%; cigarettes 16%; marijuana 4%;                          cocaine 0.7%.          * 10th-graders - alcohol 40%; cigarettes 22%; marijuana 8%;                          cocaine 0.7%.          * 12th-graders - alcohol 51%; cigarettes 28%; marijuana 12%;                          cocaine 1.3%.      Among 12th-graders, use of marijuana, cocaine and inhalants     declined over the year before.  Not so with LSD.      * 2% of eighth-graders have tried LSD in the last year, up 24%     over 1991.       * Use of LSD among seniors is at its highest point since 1982; 6%     tried it in the last year.      Reducing drug use among students \"requires a different kind of     strategy\" that Health Secretary Donna Shalala says will be part     of an overall illness prevention plan.      The survey shows drugs are easier to get and fewer eighth-graders     disapprove of them.      \"It\\'s scary,\" Shalala says.  \"Dealers are focusing on younger, more     vulnerable kids.\"   Scott Kennedy,  Brewer and Patriot',\n",

       "  '          Good I had a bad feeling about this problem because of a special case with no solution that worried me.  Four coplanar points in the shape of a square have no unique sphere  that they are on the surface of. Similarly 4 colinear point have no finite sized sphere that they are on the surface of.  These algorithms being geometrical designed rather than algebraically design meet these problems neatly.  When determining which plane the 3 points are on if they are colinear the algorithm should afil or return infinite R. When intersecting the two lines there are 2 possibilities they are the same line  (the 4 points were on a planar circle) they are different lines but parallel. There is a sphere of in radius.  This last case can be achieved with 3 colinier points and any 4th point by taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be produced  it can also be achieved by  If all 4 points are coplanar but are not on one circle.   It seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the 4 points are coplanar. The algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar. (4 points being colinear => coplanar)  Testing if the 4th point is coplanar when the plane of the first 3 points has been found is trivial.  ',\n",
       "  '     From what I read, the other fellow told Salameh how to put it together over the phone.  The bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated type, so to put a (I assume complicated) sophisticated bomb together from instructions _over the phone_ (!) one must need some brains I would expect.    I read this in an article in \"The Australian Muslim Times\", the newspaper (weekly) of the Australian Muslim community.    If this is true, perhaps one of the Muslims based in North America (if they see this posting) can elaborate.       I don\\'t deny this fact.  The thrust of my argument here is that   (a) Salameh is, according to US law, innocent as he has not been found guilty in a court of law.  As his guilt has not been established, it is wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.  (b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhaps have not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is _not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and _in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important  distinction.  I should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say \"Muslim\".  In general, anyone who calls themselves a \"Muslim\" and does not do or  outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam is considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to Islam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a Muslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential principles, though, then one does leave Islam.  The term \"Muslim\" is to be contrasted with \"Mu\\'min\", which means \"true believer\".  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu\\'min is something known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you will not find the term Mu\\'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism, because it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I, for example, am a \"true believer\" or not.  For example, I could just be putting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to what I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say \"Muslims\" we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in practice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.  By \"Muslim\" we do not necessarily mean \"Mu\\'min\", or \"true believer\" in Islam.',\n",
       "  ' No, but I have several other breakdowns of accidental shootings. I\\'ve never seen one that specifically provides the info that Davis insists that he has, so I\\'d love to have a cite.   Wrong.  There\\'s one gun design where that can happen, and it is supposed to be carried with the hammer over an unloaded chamber. (Cocking the gun turns the cylinder so that a loaded cylinder is under the hammer.  In other words, it can be usefully carried in a safe manner.)  Other handgun designs don\\'t have that property; if their trigger isn\\'t pulled, the hammer can\\'t hit the firing pin.   The breakdowns that I do have include the above category.  From them I can safely say that if Davis is right in ALL of his claims, a large negative number of people are killed by animals, because we know that the number of killings by wackos is reasonably large and that the number of accidents due to gun failures (which is a superset of the described circumstance) is near zero.

       "  '   I think that you are changing the meaning of \"values\" here. Perhaps it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.  value n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods or service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in  usefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality considered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as of a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus.  The relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or lightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech sound.   In context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms of scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that these definitions do not mean the same thing.  In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the word \"value\" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard of measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its basis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one concludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on systems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a scientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as \"objective values.\"  Back to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow. Just because the word \"values\" is used in both contexts does not mean that there is a relationship between the two contexts.  If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering the meaning of the word \"objective\" I doubt that this will ever happen.  So, back to the original question:  And objective morality is.....?  If you can provide an objective foundation for \"morality\" then that will be a good beginning. ',\n",
