       "['How difficult would it be to do a solar sail mission to say mercury?  Not much has been there and there is a 23?KM/s delta v to eat off.  could a  solar sail, handle say adiscovery bus, and drop it into mercury orbit,  good enough for rockets to put it into some form of polar orbit?',\n",
       " ' You\\'re assuming that \"go solar\" = \"photovoltaic\".  Solar dynamic power (turbo-alternators) doesn\\'t have this problem.  It also has rather less air drag due to its higher efficiency, which is a non-trivial win for big solar plants at low altitude.  Now, you might have to replace the *rest* of the electronics fairly often, unless you invest substantial amounts of mass in shielding.   References?  Such treaties have been *proposed*, but as far as I know, none of them has ever been negotiated or signed.',\n",
       " \" Actually, Hiten wasn't originally intended to go into lunar orbit at all, so it indeed didn't have much fuel on hand.  The lunar-orbit mission was an afterthought, after Hagoromo (a tiny subsatellite deployed by Hiten during a lunar flyby) had a transmitter failure and its proper insertion into lunar orbit couldn't be positively confirmed.  It should be noted that the technique does have disadvantages.  It takes a long time, and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit.

The inflation process would have to be carefully controlled.  The space environment reduces ductility in exposed materials (due to temperature extremes, monotomic Oxygen impingement, and radiation effects on materials), so your \"fabric\" may not retain any flexibility for long.  (This may not matter.)  Even after inflation, pressure changes in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric, which could lead to holes and tears as ductility decreases.

       " \" I was at an interesting seminar at work (UK's R.A.L. Space Science Dept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail proposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to generate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out at the meeting. Here goes :      The Microlight Solar Sail    -------------------------  1. Introduction The solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of sunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a vehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.  However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most people realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per square kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized fabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type spacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte idea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.  2.Design Recent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a tiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely be electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control methods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a panel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.  The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at Edinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data gathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and communication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface of the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.  3.Missions The craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example: a) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor groups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit rate. b) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved areas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to reflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive sunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these locations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar base, BTW] c) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet nucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged tube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an ideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat is reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300 deg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating container.

       " '  I can\\'t see the need for a single (big? expensive? heavy?) \"mothership\" except for Voyager style flyby missions. A few years ago, I did some calculations on a \"Grand Tour\" space probe launched by a Saturn V in 1975-76. At the time,I felt  that the idea of a big \"mother ship\" had some merit - the Voyagers had to be rather small, lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak Titan III/Centaur launchers. The concept I examined (and Michael\\'s?) had a lot in common with the British Interplanetary Society\\'s Daedalus project for sending a probe to Barnard\\'s Star - i.e. a large \"bus\" spacecraft carrying several smaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination. The Saturn V supposedly would have been able to launch a 10-ton payload towards Jupiter and beyond. The \"bus\" could have included far more powerful cameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful power source than the Voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore. Extremely important as the Voyagers had to perform most of their measurements within a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter, and usually at a relatively great distance. --- The smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the \"real\" Voyagers, and an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards Pluto in the early 21st century, and would have been released at various points during the mission. The advantages are obvious: the bus would have carried out the same basic Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune mission than Voyager 2 did, but in addition two \"sub-probes\" could have been relased at Saturn, examining that planet\\'s south polar regions before moving on to Pluto. This would have enabled NASA to map both hemispheres of Pluto/Charon by 1986...and several other probes could have examined parts of the Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune systems that weren\\'t examined in great detail by the Voyagers due to trajectory-related factors. A small \"swarm\" of camera-equipped miniature space probes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a  small Voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy,  well-equipped spacecraft. And would we have learned a lot more about the outer planets! The reason why the Grand Tour was cancelled was lack of money, of course.   MARCU$',\n",

Our sounding rocket payload, with telemetry, guidance, etc. etc. and a telescope cluster, weighs around 1100 pounds.  It uses freon jets for steering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ie during our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty much continuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).  The jets also need to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization, and flip the payload around to look at the Sun.  We have two freon tanks, each holding ~5 liters of freon (I'm speaking only from memory of the last flight).

       " 'Ed Campion Headquarters, Washington, D.C.                             April 23, 1993 (Phone:  202/358-1780)  Kyle Herring Johnson Space Center, Houston (Phone:  713/483-5111)  RELEASE:  93-76  HUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS   The December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 to service the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 day mission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability for an additional two, if needed.   The decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, was reached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver times required using the Shuttle\\'s robot arm based on software simulations and actual EVA tasks on previous missions.   \"Basically what we\\'ve done by going to five EVAs rather than three is to repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the dynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks,\" Mission Director Randy Brinkley said. \"It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added flexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations.\"   In laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the spacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays and the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectives during the mission.   \"When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through lowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays, WF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for each spacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate,\" said Milt Heflin, Lead Flight Director for the mission.   While the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two alternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than previous missions requiring two, three or four EVAs.   \"We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous spacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,\" Heflin said.  \"In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary to formulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible to accomplish the mission objectives.\"   Planning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions that include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integrated simulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand alone underwater training \"runs\" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.   Various refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be made based on actual training experience during the months prior to the mission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight will be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.   Endeavour\\'s June flight and Discovery\\'s July mission both will include spacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission. The evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the actual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala.   Also, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining further insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the experience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and trainers.   Designed to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with grapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.   The telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At that time the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in 1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have become necessary.',\n",

Nor is it a trivial piece of hardware, since it has to include attitude control (HST's own is not strong enough to compensate for things like thruster imbalance), guidance (there is no provision to feed gyro data from HST's own gyros to an external device), and separation (you don't want it left attached afterward, if only to avoid possible contamination after the telescope lid is opened again).  You also get to worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost is done and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle (the lid stays closed for the duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from thrusters and the like).  The original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do the reboost.  The OMV was planned to be a sort of small space tug, well suited to precisely this sort of job.

       " 'Two developments have brought these type of activities back to the forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a 20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from the Mir Space Station.  While this \"Banner\" reflector was blank, NPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner reflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space- based video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV commercial, as filmed from the Mir.    The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the same company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga booster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the \"Environmental Billboard\".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the University of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the \"Environmental Billboard\" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to 804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area, deployed by the inflatable \\'frame\\'.    To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry \"ozone reading sensors\" to \"continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\\'s delicate protective ozone layer,\" according to Mike Lawson, head of SMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum exposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\\'s atmosphere. According to IMI, \"as the biodegradable material burns, it will release ozone-building components that will literally replenish the ozone layer.\" The remaining spacecraft will monitor the atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns up and \"adds to the ozone supply.\"    This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several millions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI estimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who watched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \\'unit\\' cost $600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being promoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.    But back to Brian\\'s questions:        See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my estimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus $10-15 M for a launch), then it\\'s probably real.  They are claiming to tailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for optimum advertising impact so they probably can\\'t piggy back upon someone else\\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated launch.  That\\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.     And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as well.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use of launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\\'t think the legal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer, and no, I don\\'t really like the idea of this additional light pollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive aspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the advertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change positive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the space advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an idiot?)    (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\\'s in a low enough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before dawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just after dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\\'s the time of worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still be a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)     As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There were about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga advertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for only a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\\'t heard of any serious funding for this, but I\\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.

       " 'Brian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]        Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the Commercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:    SPACE ADVERTISING     First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very common practice to put the cooperating organization\\'s logos on the space launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the (very prominent) logos on its side of    - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)    - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)    - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and    - the GPS/Navstar program office    This has not been considered \"paid advertising\" but rather \"public relations\", since the restrictions have been such that only organizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the side, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting a 10\\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras is \"advertising\" as much as it is \"public relations\", in my opinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has rather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]    There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials for use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large advertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of several serious studies in the early and mid 1980\\'s which looked at putting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload bay.  These ventures would be different than \"public relations\", in that the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms participating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for the right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For example, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a Disneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras would scan past it.)    ADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES    The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about 1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed to pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe company was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly, Soviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last Olympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from participating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for example, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the British visiting cosmonaut to Mir.    Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch vehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET recoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements on the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\\'s upcoming movie \"The Last Action Hero\".  Besides the usual logos of the participating organizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the main fuselage of the mission\\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster rockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for one month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in Space News magazine a couple of months ago.    (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is talking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he created with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising sponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the space program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on the upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it \"would not use his idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and receiving compensation.\"   This is being disputed, since the launch is a \"commercial launch\" and NASA is receiving none of the advertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is coming from NASA.)

Finally,  the HST arrays _do_ have the ability to be detached--remember, they're  going to be replaced with new arrays.  However, as an ACS guy who's seen his branch management pull their collective hair out over HST, I would voice a hearty 'yea' to using conventional arrays over bi-stems, whenever possible.  No half hertz flexible modes, no thermal snap, no problem.\",\n",
       " \" You don't *need* to, but it's desirable.  HST, like all satellites in low Earth orbit, is gradually losing altitude due to air drag.  It was deployed in the highest orbit the shuttle could reach, for that reason. It needs occasional reboosting or it will eventually reenter.  (It has no propulsion system of its own.)  This is an excellent opportunity, given that there may not be another visit for several years.\",\n",

Seriously, though, you're never going to get a 10-meter scope into orbit as cheaply as you can build one on the ground, and with adaptive optics and a good site, the difference in quality is narrowed quite a bit anyway.  Also, scopes in low orbit (like Hubble) can only observe things continuously for ~45 minutes at a time, which can be a serious limitation.   I sure as hell does if the 'point of light' is half a degree in extent and as bright as the moon.  Have you ever noticed how much brighter the night sky is on a moonlit night?    Existing satellites *are* points of light, but an advertising sign that appeared as a point would be useless, so I rather think these will appear larger than a 'typical' satellite.  Also, satellite tracks *are* ruining lots of plates in the current Palomar Sky Survey.  What deparment are you in anyway, Philosophy?

Also, I need.  1)  current orbital parameters of HST   2)  projected  orbital parameters after re-boost.  3)  Discovery's  DRY weight  4) HST's Dry weight.    So how long do they need to train?  a year?  2 years?  somehow I think 2-3 moths should be adequate.   Also because they significantly lacked on-orbit EVA experience.   The HST is designed for on-orbit servicing.  it should be a lot easier.   There comes a time in every project, to kill the management.  They can if neccessary, re-schedule the  HST mission.  December is not a drop dead date, unlike say the LDEF retrieval mission.      I suspect, the BUS-1, may not have enough basic thrust for the HST re-boost.  it mayu need bigger tanks,  or bigger thrusters.

I know when HST was first flown, it was placed in the Highest possible Shuttle orbit.   Now the shuttle can cary a thing called the EDO pallet, or extended duration orbiter pallet.  It's mostly  LOX/LH for the fuel cells and RCS gear,  plus more O2  and canisters for the life support re-breathers.  maybe more nitrogen too.  THe limit on space-walking is a function of suit supplies (MASS) and Orbiter Duration.     In order to perform the re-boost of the HST, the OMS engines will be fired for a long period.  Now the shuttle is a heavy thing.  THe HST isn't light either.  THe amount of OMS fuel needed to fly both up is substantial.   a small booster carried up and used to boost HST on it's own will weigh significantly less then the OMS fuel required to Boost  both HST and SHUttle, for a given orbital change.    From what i understand,  the mass margins on the HST missions are tight enough they can't even carry extra Suits or MMU's.  Now if they used a small tug,  I would bet,  just a wild guess, that the savings on amss margin  would allow carrying the EDO pallet,  extra suits,  more consumables,  parts for the flaky FGS sensor,  parts for the balky solar  electronics,  and still enough for a double magnum of champagne.  or the HST could even get placed into  some sort of medium orbit.

       " \"SSF is up for redesign again.  Let's do it right this time!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:  [1] microgravity/vacuum process research [2] life sciences research (adaptation to space) [3] spacecraft maintenence   The old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to centralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet their targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users  took most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to  tie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization and miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these two projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement in commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial  users have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the  constellation.    Firstly, different functions are broken down into different  constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function: thus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits, comsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task is distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation, providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed.  SSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments and are also prime candidates for constellization.  [1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now: COMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for short-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is inexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities  on Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab to a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET. We might also expand the research program to take advantage of  interesting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt  or gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can be much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a  station is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.  [2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity, but also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation environments of deep space instead of the protected shelter of LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since astronauts will have little practical use in the space program until costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using astronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation, and the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation tether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity in super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the radiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars, Earth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support machinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR interface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown, follow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface, testing out the actual environment at low cost before $billions are spent on astronauts.  [3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in  Clarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can practice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck solar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs, inject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be spun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat companies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.  By applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting rid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we have radically improved the capability of the program while greatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag, we can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study life's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety  of space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum research inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose orbits.  N.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration as well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.   Mars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously  we can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used to fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and sample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can be used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology greenhouses on Mars at low cost.  \",\n",

NASA would provide contractual launch services. However, since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates (WN 26 Mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. This may look like environmental vandalism, but Mike Lawson, CEO of Space Marketing, told us yesterday that the real purpose of the project is to help the environment! The platform will carry ozone monitors he explained--advertising is just to help defray costs. ..........  What do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize the night sky? It is not even April 1 anymore. What about light pollution in observations? (I read somewhere else that it might even be visible during the day, leave alone at night). Is NASA really supporting this junk? Are protesting groups being organized in the States? Really, really depressed.               Enzo',\n",

You will be \"subject to some ad agency\\'s \\'poor taste\\'\"    While I\\'m sure Sagan considers it sacrilegious, that wouldn\\'t be because of his doubtfull credibility as an astronomer. Modern,  ground-based, visible light astronomy (what these proposed orbiting billboards would upset) is already a dying field: The opacity and distortions caused by the atmosphere itself have driven most of the field to use radio, far infrared or space-based telescopes. In any case, a bright point of light passing through the field doesn\\'t ruin observations. If that were the case, the thousands of existing satellites would have already done so (satelliets might not seem so bright to the eyes, but as far as astronomy is concerned, they are extremely bright.)',\n",
       " \" The Centaur that is being built for T4 would be a better bet to integrate  onto the Proton as the T4/Centaur is designed for the Extremely Harsh  envorinment of the T4 launch. It is also closer to 4 m in diameter.   You've hit on the real kicker, however. The Centaur is pressure stabilized.  It cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks. Additionally,  the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~+/- 5 psi.  That is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. The pressure  stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. On numerous occasions (when I was there 88-91) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make  a non-pressure stabilized centaur. The answer -- a centaur not worth launching.   The Atlas/Centaur does not require on-pad integration, however the T4/Centaur does. I believe the on-pad integration is to a great extent due to the  cleanliness requirements and PFL configuration, so maybe something can be  done there........    The addition of LOX/LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it  lifts off. A LHe facility is also needed. I don't know what the proton uses  for fuel, but since they are derived from ICBM's I would suspect that they  use storable propellants which don't have the ullage problem that cryo's  do. If there is no cryo at the sight at all, the addition of these systems  could be big $$, not to mention the real tech transfer issues involved with  providing centaur GSE to Russia. That issue alone might be enough to kill  this idea.  \",\n",

They also had some problems with launch facilities at just the wrong time to get them started properly.  If memory serves, the pad used for the Mars Observer launch had just come out of heavy refurbishment work that had prevented launches from it for a year or so.  There have been a few CT launches.

It was easy to imagine him taking practical steps to modify the sodium lamps on the street outside Mill Hill observatory with a 12-gauge shotgun :-)  However, seriously, it is possible to limit the effects of streetlights, by adding a reflector, so that the light only illuminates the ground, which is after all where you need it. As a bonus, the power consumption required for a given illumination level is reduced. Strangely enough, astronomers often seek to lobby elected local authorities to use such lighting systems, with considerable success in the desert areas around the major US observatories. At least, thats what McNally told us, all those years ago. ( British local authorities couldn`t care less, as far as I can see )  I suppose that the \"right\" to dark skies is no more than an aspiration, but it is a worthwhile one.

As published in \"US Industrial Outlook 1993\"  (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space  business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M.     In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had  shown double digits growth rates, this year\\'s projected results are  driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are  projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7  satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also  projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year,  and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to  $450 M, future sales will be \"adversely affected by the downward  revision in Department of Defense launch plans.\"                               Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries,  revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to  increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from  broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products  and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

In general, not a bad  report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite  manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth  $100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual  projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market  sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very  successful in regaining international market share in the satellite  business.     Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in  the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid- year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including  such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals)  appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually  publishes a listing of  \"Space Business Indicators\" in mid-year, and  the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released  then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if  the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the  numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth.     Looking beyond this year\\'s data, future markets look quite  promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top  $3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct  broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite  station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year  through the mid 1990\\'s.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic  for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for  substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the  next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative  assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and  satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don\\'t believe all of the  current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite  market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will  be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive  as currently projected.)     It should also be noted this year\\'s DoC data is the first  release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research  facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for  the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space  Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first  sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.]   2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS    McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta  launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola  Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to  launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO  communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas  was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract.     The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium  constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium  satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be  launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle  launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be  launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.   Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a  planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although  details of the launch services contract were reported to be  negotiation, and not yet final.     The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of  their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5  million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36  launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These  launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF\\'s Global  Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other  programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is  expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected  to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.   Under this contract the USAF can also request \"launch on demand\"  services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to  occur within 40 days of the request.      [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should  provide an excellent business base for MDC\\'s Delta launch program  through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two con tracts have  a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and  sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts  for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA  Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping  MDC as a viable commerical launch company.      However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these  contracts.  Motorola\\'s Iridium LEO communications constellation has  not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for  operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing  and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these  approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.   But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year.     Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of  several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of  the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III  program in favor of the USAF NLS/\"Spacelifter\" program.  At this  time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future  funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts  is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy  reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and  Congress propose cancellation of all \"ELV upgrade\" programs  (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed \"Spacelifter\"  program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year\\'s budget  deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to  find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]    3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC \"GO-AHEAD\"    The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing  satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of  Commerce\\'s Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to  WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and  operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral  images of the Earth.     [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture  by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the  operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the  request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new  venture as a \"Star Wars\" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to  provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into  digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable  customers for this service include exploration geologists,  agricultural planners, and urban planners.      It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the  1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last  November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote  sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to  this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to  all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures  would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices.     There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote  sensing ventures working their way through the system at different  stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite  systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing  data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large,  government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures  such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use  innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the  margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures  appearing in the next year or so.]                    4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD\\'S SPACE BIZ \"STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT\"     Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General  Dynamic\\'s Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker,  despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent  analyst\\'s report Morgan Stanley said \"We are more than ever  convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical  95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash- generating unit.\"  Based upon discussions with GD\\'s corporate  management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are  cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and  $100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD\\'s projection of  capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market.     [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has  hurt General Dynamic\\'s Space Systems Division.  Since GD has  restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses,  many market pundits have been speculating GD\\'s space business might  be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD\\'s Space  Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current  problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected  to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of  about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space  launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability  of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits  from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur  program is back on track, this division will continue to show  substantial losses.     In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation  is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.   To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional  management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.   In GD SSD\\'s case, to get the division back on track, the management  team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with  the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would  indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch  operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince  customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would  have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in  marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for  this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly  McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash  flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction  (Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed),  or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the  $700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of  change for any company.]    5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND    Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is  projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990\\'s.  In early  February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which  detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the  next decade.     Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant  position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54  international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane  holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics\\' Atlas vehicle holds 14  contracts, McDonnell Douglas\\' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall\\'s Long  March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts.     Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can  compete are projected to come from communications satellites with  the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and  scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand  growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region.     Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of  individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will  continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with  larger communications payloads carrying more transponders.  Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications  satellites should increase by 20 % over today\\'s average level, to  about 3000 kg in GEO.     Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain  strong over th e next three years, but in the second half of the  decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace  bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder  demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques  appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing  or near-term transponders.     One of the significant possible changes in the market was  identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian  launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term,  investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade  off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and  other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities  and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal.     [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and  I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.   Comparing the two surveys, there aren\\'t outstanding differences in  the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new  data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical  transponders on orbit.    I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space- based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While  fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the  established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing  demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to- multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space  transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability  service, but only from established point A to established point B.  To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable  between the points, and while there are improved network solutions,  installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost  millions or billions of dollars.      For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground  network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective  solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is  cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of  thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite  network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and  has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is  growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced,  it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to  handle the increase in traffic.     Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still  growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But  satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current  generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of  on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from  last generation\\'s satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch  demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite  launches over longer intervals.     And as last note; Arianespace didn\\'t flag it this year, but it  looks like the space transportation market will be rather over- supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual  commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites  per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up  to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of  about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8,  Japan\\'s H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia\\'s Proton capable of 8, and other  systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per  year.  That\\'s a lot of capability for a small market.     We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial  launches.]  6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT     The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has  spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety  rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt  the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation  of range safety rules.      In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of  two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure  typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at  Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute  before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was  overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the  communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the  valid abort call.     Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort  command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an  investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to  launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed.     Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety  Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This  investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an  incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their  investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at  lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used  in the launch.    [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an  investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested  by the Department of Commerce\\'s Office of Commercial Space  Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.      At the time of writing this column, some of the initial  investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are  starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four  different communications channels were in use during the test. After  the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test  director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops  Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.   According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch.  Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the  NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying  the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing  explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the  best set being that clear lines of communications and clear  definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and  understanding of the mission rules were not established before the  launch.      As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these  procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.    This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has  been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they  do with commercial aircraft problems).      I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with  procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance  of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how  specific lines of authority should be delineated.]   7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED    Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new  small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.   Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the \"Aerokosmos\"  winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the \"Severkosmos\",  launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is  projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to  an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430  kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used  with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called  \\'Sineva\\'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military  establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of  spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the  Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia  facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow.     [Commentary: There\\'s very little released information on this new  venture.  My suspicion  is it is another Russian enterprise looking  for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house  knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous  commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union.     This one\\'s a little different in that they are offering variants  of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can\\'t identify any key customers being  targeted or substantial financial backing.]  8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING    In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the  results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial  rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland  Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary  study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch  site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected  low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic  considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal  for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses.     [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the  Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still  proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland  found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if  substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected  returns were too low to justify the cost of development.      This might point out some key discriminators in judging the  feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:   - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage  sufficient to recover setup costs?   - Is there a market advantage of using the site?   - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?   - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the  investment?      Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at  Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore  Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against  these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying  on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]  9- SPAIN\\'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING    In one of his last official acts, former President Bush  authorized space technology transfer for several joint space  ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed  use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that  regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch  vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first  launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as  a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into  LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system,  including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.   Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in  development funding, and will use technology from Argentina\\'s Condor  launch vehicle as well as from the US.     [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity  in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small  payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either  Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.   However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout  program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the  Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on  system).      This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch  system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of  such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies  have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche  Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the  Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to  find any other European development work with even a rumor of  funding for hardware.     Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the  Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting  rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space  launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled  the country in the 1970\\'s and early 1980\\'s.     What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally  transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new  civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de  Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described  as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket  program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German  firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq  in the mid-1980\\'s.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and  tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package  lagged that of the propulsion system.     It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first  scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B  satellite will study the Earth\\'s upper atmosphere and includes  cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has  yet been selected, but OSC\\'s Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air  launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this  contract.]   10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP    PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in  late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract  from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro\\'s PA-2  launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar  Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish  Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and  offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According  to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya  launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully- enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like  the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as \"the main  alternative rocket supplier\" for the small satellite launch service  to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the  Swedish satellite was not specified.     [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and  funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a  small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From  PacAstro\\'s literature, the engines designed for the PA-series  rockets are built of \"off the shelf\" components based upon the Lunar  MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a  225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.      PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its  first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and  2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired  TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary  engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder  closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same  building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering,  launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support.  Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the  board of directors.      PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least  $550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been  searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to  design, build and launch their first set of vehicles.     The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help  bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need  much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real  hardware.]   11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED     In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications  venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.   As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC),  headquartered in Taiwam and with li nks to the ruling Nationalist  Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China  Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional  communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite  system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the  satellite\\'s communications channels.      [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the  release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid  January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of  Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg  scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional  satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has  been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530  M) through 2006.      I haven\\'t been able to establish any relationship between this  venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.   While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the  current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two  separate sastellite ventures.     The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is \"Asiasat- 2\", but I don\\'t thinks this has any relationship with the existing  Hong Kong-based \"Asiasat\" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and  other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational  model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing  venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to  Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later  satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between  Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture  through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to  proceed.     In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with  substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This  is just another indicator to add to the list.]   12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES    South Korea\\'s Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently  announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and  another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for  advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been  specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with  manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by  1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea\\'s  aerospace technology to the level of the world\\'s top 10 countries by  2000.                                     [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its  national aerospace industry, specifically including space  activities. I\\'m noting this as a flag that potential new players are  coming into the commercial space market.     As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications  satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995  on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide  television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula,  southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea.     South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on  Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US  $8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of  this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely \"made in Korea.\"   Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment- monitoring micro-satellite.     This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth  observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System)  project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean  government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with  optical and microwave sensors.    South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel  military effort to establish the capabilities for building and  launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a  government panel had been established to oversee such an effort,  funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an   expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the  Korean peninsula.           In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean  is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing  aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is  offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as  part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of  consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports  satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has  announced teaming for production of OSC\\'s Orbcomm user terminals.).      This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.   Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector  for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a  South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition  of commercial space market there over the next decade.]   13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH    As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the  results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and  investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of  March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the  market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+%  of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a  general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The  increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which  is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this  trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite  well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms  which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its  results in all of 1993.  We\\'ll keep an eye on these ....

As I said at the start  of this, column there\\'s been a lot of interesting happenings - but  I\\'ll have to put them into the next issue.      Looking ahead, I\\'ve got several articles in the works on new  happenings with Iridium and the LEO communications satellite market,  more news on international launchers appearing (and disappearing) on  the market, new international commercial space ventures,  and other  interesting developments.

       " 'Reading from a Amoco Performance Products data sheet, their ERL-1906 resin with T40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive strength of 280,000 psi.  It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in, therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column that can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft, or 75 Statute miles.  Now, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss type, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength. Let us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical  strength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant section column.    A constant section column is not the limit on how high you can build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section as you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound load to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in calculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross sectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure below the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile  below the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.  The next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section to support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way to the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical limit on area, although there will be practical limits based on how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how much load you need to support on the ground (for which you need a foundation that the bedrock can support.  Let us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction cost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites, assuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure is just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass ratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower height becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant atmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still have to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses will be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity, but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus they represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting from the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.  This analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind loads.

       " 'Re; Response from CoB of Boeing on SSTO ...       Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carried out extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some time.  A good reference on this might be: \"Comparison of Propulsion Options for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF-92- 0639).\" by V.A. Weldon and L.E. Fink from Boeing.   The paper describes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve aircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems associated with liquid hydrogen fuel.  Basically, it\\'s a high-speed airplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane    The design (the concept is also called \"Beta\") as laid out in the paper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000 pounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and life support.  System design reliability is .9995.    Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets and 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans.  A 108-foot- long reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first- stage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavy payload on an expendable second stage.    To launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like a normal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3.  At that point the turbofans, modified to burn catalyzed JP-7, would shut off and the ramjets, would take over.  At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swing out, ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land like aircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions.    Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff is about 1.5 M lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225. The orbiter stages weighs about 400,Klbs including 335 Klbs of LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust rocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin, with the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by- 25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX would be stored aft.  Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design\\'s success is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact tankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel.      The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design.  They conclude while a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost, a TSTO is easier, cheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greater safety and mission versatility and doesn\\'t carry the hard-to-handle and bulky hydrogen fuel. The conlcude \"In conjunction with its major use of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self- ferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provide as close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical configuration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can be shown to be operationally viable.\"       Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for some time.  I expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHL SSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re- examined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter.    Does it threaten DC-???.  Possibly -- There is a set of on-going studies trying straighten out the government\\'s future space transportation strategy.  MDC and Boeing (as well as other firms) are providing data to a joint study team back in DC.  There are various factions and options vying for attention -- including shuttle upgrades, shuttle replacement (what was called the \"4-2-3\" architecture), SpaceLifter, ELV upgrades, and various advanced vehicles (ALES, Beta, DC-??, NASP, FSTS, SSTOs of several types, etc.)  NASA/DOD/DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy for future US gov\\'t space transportation systems, and trying to juggle near-term launch needs (like for DoD and NASA) against medium-term needs (including commercial considerations), and against the investment and risk of going to \"leap frog\" new technologies like SDIO/SSTO and NASP and Beta.    It\\'s a heck of a problem.  The worst part of the problem isn\\'t that there aren\\'t promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozens of them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in the near term.

       " ' (excerpts from posting on this topic)    (I\\'ve seen satellites at midnight - they\\'re not only in twilight.) :o)    Now my comments:   I\\'d like to add that some of the \"protests\" do not come from a strictly  practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for  research activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I  would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may  never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred -  unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars  as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and  a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time  - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man.  Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.   Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there  and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief  in an afterlife.    The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks  and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light  crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people  is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating  the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or  thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.   But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky.   Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live  in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport  currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The  impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists  that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped  into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life  forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels  (or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains  one weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing,  malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed  the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80  miles to the east.  (Their \\'security light\\' didn\\'t help matters  much either.)  But I\\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of  high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect.   But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\\'t  fouled in some way.  (I mean they\\'ve been TRYING this forever -  like, concerning Tesla\\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\\'t watch  commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer,  truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.   If ya\\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at  least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.    To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage  of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at  8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the  local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\\'ll be trying to see it  if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could  be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky  while complaining about billboards proposed by others.

Since my note taking ability is by no means infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is  granted to copy this without restriction.  Note for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing a single staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3 scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is  currently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale  experimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.  On April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled  \"Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions\" here at the University of Illinois. Mr Nelson\\'s job involves using software to simulate trajectories and determine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he is not directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with  them recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used  the DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don\\'t think the details of implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope they aren\\'t - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you will be interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.  The first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  The main restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume that this is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but I did not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters and 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in  mid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.

Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel the accelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are  throtled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it soon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in  accelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines bring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut out entirely.  The engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimed for an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of air drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to  that desired.  Questions from the audience:  (paraphrased)  Q:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than     all at once?  A:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.  Q:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?  A:  Can\\'t tell us.  \"Read Aviation Leak.\"  He also apparently had a good      propulsion example, but was told not to use it.    My question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting national security or MD protecting their own interests?  The second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitch up maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and  the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphs of heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar, and I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate. The end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would have about 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it\\'s reentry profile about  60 degrees south latitude.  I would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn\\'t know about that aspect of the flight profile. ',\n",

       " '    {Description of \"External Tank\" option for SSF redesign deleted}   Yo Ken, let\\'s keep on-top of things! Both the \"External Tank\" and \"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign options list. Today\\'s (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports that O\\'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have been dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks used in launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station around an existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"  Currently, there are three options being considered, as presented to the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in today\\'s Times).  Option \"A\" - Low Cost Modular Approach This option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside, there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting the SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and Reston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective teams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this option are:   -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that\\'s      qualified for STS and ELV\\'s. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C      Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this      for the Air Force.   -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.      SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle      flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.      Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power      source for 30 day missions.   -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term      of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the      US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing      SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International      Partners\\' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The      Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.      The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.   -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and      add another 20 kW of power   -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,      the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return      Vehicle).  Option \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived The Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin. This option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we have all come to know and love :)  This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for use on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the  number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit, for both options \"A\" and \"B\".  The build-up occurs in six phases:   -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power      is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when      it visits.   -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist      language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is      deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.   -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by      keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes      there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the      second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).   -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,      with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal      control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.   -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,      the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the      assembly in 24 flights.  Most of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option,  with the exception of the data management system, which has major changes.',\n",

       " \"Okay, lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun.   The project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for the Laser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas guns have to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically located across the road from the Free Electron Laser building, and the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls) from which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the office he works for is an administrative convenience.  I visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun. At the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work, but I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),  The gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber about 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe). The chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several hundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston is hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens of atmospheres.  The piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi. The barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch bore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they intersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel could be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to move the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used in testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter and about 50 cm long.  All of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen gas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the barrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a sheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The plastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped in the barrel ahead of the projectile.    The gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic water jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic projectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing, the projectile vaporizes.  The testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is about 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km if fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun to Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can fire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB to follow the projectiles.  The design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4 km/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s, and the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test they blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it had to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but I haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).  There are people waiting to test scramjet components in this gun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12= 4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.  This gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically a proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful- sized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of 100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg useful payload to orbit.  Dani Eder \",\n",

(I ain\\'t saying that dark skies are included in these  rights, although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them.)     Anyway, here are my thoughts on this:    I\\'d like to add that some of the \"protests\" do not come from a strictly  practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for  research activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I  would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may  never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred -  unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars  as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and  a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time  - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man.  Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.   Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there  and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief  in an afterlife.    The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks  and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light  crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people  is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating  the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or  thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.   But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky.   Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live  in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport  currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The  impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists  that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped  into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life  forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels  (or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains  one weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing,  malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed  the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80  miles to the east.  (Their \\'security light\\' didn\\'t help matters  much either.)  But I\\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of  high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect.   But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\\'t  fouled in some way.  (I mean they\\'ve been TRYING this forever -  like, concerning Tesla\\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\\'t watch  commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer,  truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.   If ya\\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at  least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.    To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage  of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at  8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the  local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.

One day, I hope, humans will be able to look out, not upon half the heavens, with only nature-creted lights, but upon all of the heavens, with no lights.

       " ' The sightings were apparently spurious.  There is no planet inside of the orbit of Mercury.  The idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury\\'s observed perihelion precession and the value it should have had according to Newtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observations and calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe later improved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier\\'s system of equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune and since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit of Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was afoot with Mercury.  But alas, \\'twere not so.  Mercury\\'s perihelion precesses at the rate it does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly curved due to the sun\\'s mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915 and Albert Einstein\\'s synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian  geometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one of it\\'s most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession of Mercury\\'s perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcomb\\'s numbers rather than Leverrier\\'s.)  Of course not everybody believes Einstein, and that\\'s fine.  But subsequent efforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radar have been fruitless.  -Bill Gawne   \"Forgive him, he is a barbarian, who thinks the customs of his tribe   are the laws of the universe.\"                       - G.

For providing me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S. Space Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket Technology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to lower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind -- and I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for our generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.       Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a torch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new thing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things from past masters.       When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called experts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no sense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of the Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it, \"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space.\"  Well Dr. Rachtin -- you\\'ve made us mad!  What are these principles that SSRT defies?       Well I\\'ll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need a giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the \"fact\" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it violates the truism that you cant do anything significant for less than many billions of dollars.       It took some of the last generation\\'s experts to teach us some new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun\\'s first rocket was not a Saturn V.  General Schriever\\'s ICBM\\'s didn\\'t take ten years to demonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn\\'t cost $1 billion.       It took one of the great engineers of the 1950\\'s to remind us of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a senior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better, cheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a single stage reusable space launch system since the 1960\\'s.  Because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a little, Test a little.       Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We didn\\'t solicit a bunch of requirements -- they\\'d just change every few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The ALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better known as \"Shape Shifter\" than \"Space Lifter.\"  We didn\\'t spend a lot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When\\'s the last time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn\\'t take a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in 18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of one very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the threat that he\\'d get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if it ran over cost or schedule.       As I described what SSRT is -- and isn\\'t keep in mind its only a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps that can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But each step should follow the same principles -- a small management team -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest budget.       Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve: (See charts)       I\\'m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last generation -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950\\'s and 1960\\'s.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that can\\'t see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we could do is soft-land on Earth!       But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a little, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable and routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among you -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal protection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land horizontally, etc, etc.       I say to you -- we\\'ll see you at White Sands in June.  You bring your view-graphs, and I\\'ll bring my rocketship.  If we do what we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.

Last year (when the stock was first down), they made a big presentation on the 777, and other programs.  This year, it was much more bare-bones.  In any case, I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would hear, and so I got there early, and figured that If I didn't get to the mike, maybe they would read mine off of a card, and so I wrote it down, and handed it in.  After the meeting started, Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer written questions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only had monitors downstairs.  Naturally, I was crushed.  So, when question and answer time came, I was suprised to find my question being read and answered.  Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took. Presumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made all the difference.  So, on to the substance. The question was   Is Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport, such as a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will Boeing compete with the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed by Mcdonnell Douglass?  Well, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me, then he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, last part first.  This is to the best of my recollection what he said.  As far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a better answer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers  about that.  As far as commercialization, that is a long ways off.  The High speed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at this point.  So, this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial arena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that  they consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them to persue work on their own.  Now, I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing.  Actually, this is a mis-nomer, as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this guy is doing, however, he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space lifter contracts.  He won't tell me what he is doing, but maybe this is where the TSTO action is taking place at boeing.  At the very minimum, the chairman of the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind, and they are trying to do something with it.    Anybody know anything further? Is this really news?

I, myself, think the F-86 is a beautiful aircraft, but rest assured, I wouldn't even think of flying it in combat today. Most of us want access to space and judge vehicles on how they perform.   Not to this degree.   Why?   Your wrong. The DC approach is very tollerent of failure. It also has the advantage of far greater reliability do to its reusable nature (Shuttle isn't reusable, it's salvagable).   The flip over happens at a very low speed, not supersonic. If the DC-X shows the flip over works, it will work unless the laws of physics change.   The final DC-1 will have fully intact abort throughout the entire flight envelop. Upon re-entry for example, it can loose about 80% of available thrust and still land safely.   Everything can suffer from catastrophic failure but that's not the same thing. Shuttle simply isn't a fault tolerent design, SSTO is.   You don't put your patients in conditions where there is no way out. You wouldn't for example, give a patient a drug and not monitor them for harmful side effects would you?   You are very much in the minority. If the DC series fails to make orbit, it will still be a very worthwhile effort. It will show us EXACTLY what we do need to do to build SSTO.   Again, refering to the DC-1, it will provide fully intact abort theroughout the flight envelop. Shuttle doesn't. DC is fault tollerent, Shuttle isn't.   Not true.

       " 'McDonnell Douglas rolls out DC-X          HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. -- On a picture-perfect Southern California day, McDonnell Douglas rolled out its DC-X rocket ship last Saturday.  The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology demonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) rocket ship.          The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in mid-June.          Although there wasn\\'t a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for SSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60 million for the DC-X -- can\\'t itself afford to fund full development of a follow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for a sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government agencies.          SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for orbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent changes in SDI\\'s political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO less of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as a step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.          SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies, said Col.  Simon \"Pete\" Worden, SDIO\\'s deputy for technology.  But Worden declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the program. \"I didn\\'t make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I have available to spend,\" he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell Douglas Astronautics headquarters.          While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program\\'s orbital objective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the \"better, faster, cheaper\" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that \"leapfrog\" ahead of evolutionary technology developments.          Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a \"build a little, test a little\" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said the program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months -- showed how today\\'s engineers could move beyond the \"miracles of our parents\\' time.\"          \"The key is management,\" Worden said. \"SDIO had a very light hand on this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable.\"          Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said lean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be crucial. \"It\\'s essential we do not end up with a large management structure where the price goes up exponentially.\"          SDIO\\'s approach also won praise from two California members of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee. \"This is the direction we\\'re going to have to go,\" said Rep.  George Brown, the committee\\'s Democratic chairman. \"Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren\\'t sustainable....NASA hasn\\'t learned it yet.  SDIO has.\"          Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown\\'s Republican colleague, went further. Joking that \"a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,\" Rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it were left to the civil space agency.          Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell Douglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. \"Let\\'s not build fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let\\'s build a spaceship!\"           Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO\\'s sponsorship, he said the private sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.          McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its C-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious about a large private secotro commitment. \"On very large ventures, companies put in seed money,\" said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas\\' senior vice president for space systems. \"You need strong government investments.\"          While the government and industry continue to differ on funding for the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to development.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas Aircraft\\'s DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for the DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could eventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).          Flight tests this summer at White Sands will \"expand the envelope\" of performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The first tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle take-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to 5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000 feet.          Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final tests will include a \"pitch-over\" manever that rotates the vehicle back into a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.          The flight test series will be supervised by Charles \"Pete\" Conrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing. Now a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles aircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated check-out and access panels for easy maintainance.          If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will become a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the Pratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of thrust          Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model has a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on throttling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid turnaround.          Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ tri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union. The resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.',\n",

INTRODUCTION       From our small world we have gazed upon the cosmic ocean for untold thousands of years. Ancient astronomers observed points of light that appeared to move among the stars. They called these objects planets, meaning wanderers, and named them after Roman deities -- Jupiter, king of the gods; Mars, the god of war; Mercury, messenger of the gods; Venus, the god of love and beauty, and Saturn, father of Jupiter and god of agriculture. The stargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and meteors or shooting stars apparently falling from the sky.       Science flourished during the European Renaissance. Fundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were discovered, and the orbits of the planets around the Sun were calculated. In the 17th century, astronomers pointed a new device called the telescope at the heavens and made startling discoveries.       But the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of solar system exploration. Advancements in rocketry after World War II enabled our machines to break the grip of Earth\\'s gravity and travel to the Moon and to other planets.       The United States has sent automated spacecraft, then human-crewed expeditions, to explore the Moon. Our automated machines have orbited and landed on Venus and Mars; explored the Sun\\'s environment; observed comets, and made close-range surveys while flying past Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.       These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and understanding of the solar system. Through the electronic sight and other \"senses\" of our automated spacecraft, color and complexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared to Earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light. And dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered.       Future historians will likely view these pioneering flights through the solar system as some of the most remarkable achievements of the 20th century.        AUTOMATED SPACECRAFT       The National Aeronautics and Space Administration\\'s (NASA\\'s) automated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many shapes and sizes. While they are designed to fulfill separate and specific mission objectives, the craft share much in common.       Each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments selected for a particular mission, supported by basic subsystems for electrical power, trajectory and orientation control, as well as for processing data and communicating with Earth.       Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft instruments and systems. NASA uses both solar energy from arrays of photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its solar system missions. Rechargeable batteries are employed for backup and supplemental power.       Imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed millions of miles through space to fly but one time near a planet, only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments pointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target! To help prevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used to control spacecraft.       The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a constant gaze at selected stars. Just as Earth\\'s early seafarers used the stars to navigate the oceans, spacecraft use stars to maintain their bearings in space. With the subsystem locked onto fixed points of reference, flight controllers can keep a spacecraft\\'s scientific instruments pointed at the target body and the craft\\'s communications antennas pointed toward Earth. The thrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speed of the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at the planned distance and on the proper trajectory.       Between 1959 and 1971, NASA spacecraft were dispatched to study the Moon and the solar environment; they also scanned the inner planets other than Earth -- Mercury, Venus and Mars. These three worlds, and our own, are known as the terrestrial planets because they share a solid-rock composition.       For the early planetary reconnaissance missions, NASA employed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the Mariners. Their flights helped shape the planning of later missions. Between 1962 and 1975, seven Mariner missions conducted the first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space.       All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary power source. The first and the final versions of the spacecraft had two wings covered with photovoltaic cells. Other Mariners were equipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal bodies.       Although the Mariners ranged from the Mariner 2 Venus spacecraft, weighing in at 203 kilograms (447 pounds), to the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter, weighing in at 974 kilograms (2,147 pounds), their basic design remained quite similar throughout the program. The Mariner 5 Venus spacecraft, for example, had originally been a backup for the Mariner 4 Mars flyby. The Mariner 10 spacecraft sent to Venus and Mercury used components left over from the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter program.       In 1972, NASA launched Pioneer 10, a Jupiter spacecraft. Interest was shifting to four of the outer planets -- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune -- giant balls of dense gas quite different from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed.       Four NASA spacecraft in all -- two Pioneers and two Voyagers -- were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar system. Because of the distances involved, these travelers took anywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations. Barring faster spacecraft, they will eventually become the first human artifacts to journey to distant stars. Because the Sun\\'s light becomes so faint in the outer solar system, these travelers do not use solar power but instead operate on electricity generated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes.       NASA also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit our neighbors Mars and Venus in the middle and late 1970s. Twin Viking Landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather stations and as biology laboratories. Two advanced orbiters -- descendants of the Mariner craft -- carried the Viking Landers from Earth and then studied martian features from above.       Two drum-shaped Pioneer spacecraft visited Venus in 1978. The Pioneer Venus Orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument that allowed it to \"see\" through the planet\\'s dense cloud cover to study surface features. The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carried four probes that were dropped through the clouds. The probes and the main body -- all of which contained scientific instruments -- radioed information about the planet\\'s atmosphere during their descent toward the surface.       A new generation of automated spacecraft -- including Magellan, Galileo, Ulysses, Mars Observer, the Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini -- is being developed and sent out into the solar system to make detailed examinations that will increase our understanding of our neighborhood and our own planet.        The Sun       A discussion of the objects in the solar system must start with the Sun. The Sun dwarfs the other bodies, representing approximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system; all of the planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust and gas add up to only about 0.14 percent. This 0.14 percent represents the material left over from the Sun\\'s formation. One hundred and nine Earths would  be required to fit across the Sun\\'s disk, and its interior could hold over 1.3 million Earths.       As a star, the Sun generates energy through the process of fusion. The temperature at the Sun\\'s core is 15 million degrees Celsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), and the pressure there is 340 billion times Earth\\'s air pressure at sea level. The Sun\\'s surface temperature of 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 degrees Fahrenheit) seems almost chilly compared to its core-temperature. At the solar core, hydrogen can fuse into helium, producing energy. The Sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams of charged particles, both extending far beyond the planets.       The Sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years and has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or so. At the end of its life, the Sun will start to fuse helium into heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growing so large that it will swallow Earth. After a billion years as a \"red giant,\" it will suddenly collapse into a \"white dwarf\" -- the final end product of a star like ours. It may take a trillion years to cool off completely.       Many spacecraft have explored the Sun\\'s environment, but none have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately two-thirds of the distance from Earth to the Sun. Pioneers 5-11, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter, Voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft have all sampled the solar environment. The Ulysses spacecraft, launched on October 6, 1990, is a joint solar mission of NASA and the European Space Agency. After using Jupiter\\'s gravity to change its trajectory, Ulysses will fly over the Sun\\'s polar regions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of studies using nine onboard scientific instruments.       We are fortunate that the Sun is exactly the way it is. If it were different in almost any way, life would almost certainly never have developed on Earth.        Mercury       Obtaining the first close-up views of Mercury was the primary objective of the Mariner 10 spacecraft, launched on November 3, 1973, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After a journey of nearly five months, which included a flyby of Venus, the spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers (437 miles) of the solar system\\'s innermost planet on March 29, 1974.       Until Mariner 10, little was known about Mercury. Even the best telescopic views from Earth showed Mercury as an indistinct object lacking any surface detail. The planet is so close to the Sun that it is usually lost in solar glare. When the planet is visible on Earth\\'s horizon just after sunset or before dawn, it is obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere. Only radar telescopes gave any hint of Mercury\\'s surface conditions prior to the voyage of Mariner 10.       The photographs Mariner 10 radioed back to Earth revealed an ancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling our own Moon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the planet. These apparently were created when Mercury\\'s interior cooled and shrank, buckling the planet\\'s crust. The cliffs are as high as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310 miles).       Instruments on Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a weak magnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth the density of Earth\\'s atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon, neon and helium. When the planet\\'s orbit takes it closest to the Sun, surface temperatures range from 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees Fahrenheit) on Mercury\\'s sunlit side to -183 degrees Celsius (-298 degrees Fahrenheit) on the dark side. This range in surface temperature -- 650 degrees Celsius (1,170 degrees Fahrenheit) -- is the largest for a single body in the solar system. Mercury literally bakes and freezes at the same time.       Days and nights are long on Mercury. The combination of a slow rotation relative to the stars (59 Earth days) and a rapid revolution around the Sun (88 Earth days) means that one Mercury solar day takes 176 Earth days or two Mercury years -- the time it takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the Sun!        Mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like that of Earth. Scientists believe Mercury has a heavy iron-rich core making up slightly less than half of its volume. That would make Mercury\\'s core larger, proportionally, than the Moon\\'s core or those of any of the planets.       After the initial Mercury encounter, Mariner 10 made two additional flybys -- on September 21, 1974, and March 16, 1975 -- before control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted and the mission was concluded. Each flyby took place at the same local Mercury time when the identical half of the planet was illuminated; as a result, we still have not seen one-half of the planet\\'s surface.        Venus       Veiled by dense cloud cover, Venus -- our nearest planetary neighbor -- was the first planet to be explored. The Mariner 2 spacecraft, launched on August 27, 1962, was the first of more than a dozen successful American and Soviet missions to study the mysterious planet. As spacecraft flew by or orbited Venus, plunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on Venus\\' surface, romantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to rest.       On December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 passed within 34,839 kilometers (21,648 miles) of Venus and became the first spacecraft to scan another planet; onboard instruments measured Venus for 42 minutes. Mariner 5, launched in June 1967, flew much closer to the planet. Passing within 4,094 kilometers (2,544 miles) of Venus on the second American flyby, Mariner 5\\'s instruments measured the planet\\'s magnetic field, ionosphere, radiation belts and temperatures. On its way to Mercury, Mariner 10 flew by Venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to Earth showing cloud circulation patterns in the Venusian atmosphere.       In the spring and summer of 1978, two spacecraft were launched to further unravel the mysteries of Venus. On December 4 of the same year, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter became the first spacecraft placed in orbit around the planet.       Five days later, the five separate components making up the second spacecraft -- the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe -- entered the Venusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet. The four small, independent probes and the main body radioed atmospheric data back to Earth during their descent toward the surface. Although designed to examine the atmosphere, one of the probes survived its impact with the surface and continued to transmit data for another hour.       Venus resembles Earth in size, physical composition and density more closely than any other known planet. However, spacecraft have discovered significant differences as well. For example, Venus\\' rotation (west to east) is retrograde (backward) compared to the east-to-west spin of Earth and most of the other planets.       Approximately 96.5 percent of Venus\\' atmosphere (95 times as dense as Earth\\'s) is carbon dioxide. The principal constituent of Earth\\'s atmosphere is nitrogen. Venus\\' atmosphere acts like a greenhouse, permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but trapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into space. As a result, the planet\\'s average surface temperature is 482 degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit), hot enough to melt lead.       A radio altimeter on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter provided the first means of seeing through the planet\\'s dense cloud cover and determining surface features over almost the entire planet. NASA\\'s Magellan spacecraft, launched on May 5, 1989, has been in orbit around Venus since August 10, 1990. The spacecraft uses radar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution images of the surface.       Magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic features, faults and impact craters. Huge areas of the surface show evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows lying on top of previous ones. An elevated region named Ishtar Terra is a lava-filled basin as large as the United States. At one end of this plateau sits Maxwell Montes, a mountain the size of Mount Everest. Scarring the m ountain\\'s flank is a 100-kilometer (62-mile) wide, 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deep impact crater named Cleopatra. (Almost all features on Venus are named for women; Maxwell Montes, Alpha Regio and Beta Regio are the exceptions.) Craters survive on Venus for perhaps 400 million years because there is no water and very little wind erosion.       Extensive fault-line networks cover the planet, probably the result of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics on Earth. But on Venus the surface temperature is sufficient to weaken the rock, which cracks just about everywhere, preventing the formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like the San Andreas Fault in California.       Venus\\' predominant weather pattern is a high-altitude, high-speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid. At speeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers (225 miles) per hour, the clouds circle the planet in only four Earth days. The circulation is in the same direction -- west to east -- as Venus\\' slow rotation of 243 Earth days, whereas Earth\\'s winds blow in both directions -- west to east and east to west -- in six alternating bands. Venus\\' atmosphere serves as a simplified laboratory for the study of our weather.        Earth       As viewed from space, our world\\'s distinguishing characteristics are its blue waters, brown and green land masses and white clouds. We are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting of 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other constituents. The only planet in the solar system known to harbor life, Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 150 million kilometers (93 million miles). Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the fifth largest in the solar system, with a diameter just a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus.       Our planet\\'s rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give rise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with the atmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation coming from the Sun and other stars. Earth\\'s atmosphere protects us from meteors as well, most of which burn up before they can strike the surface. Active geological processes have left no evidence of the pelting Earth almost certainly received soon after it formed -- about 4.6 billion years ago. Along with the other newly formed planets, it was showered by space debris in the early days of the solar system.       From our journeys into space, we have learned much about our home planet. The first American satellite -- Explorer 1 -- was launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 31, 1958, and discovered an intense radiation zone, now called the Van Allen radiation belts, surrounding Earth.       Since then, other research satellites have revealed that our planet\\'s magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape by the solar wind -- the stream of charged particles continuously ejected from the Sun. We\\'ve learned that the magnetic field does not fade off into space but has definite boundaries. And we now know that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm and uneventful, seethes with activity -- swelling by day and contracting by night. Affected by changes in solar activity, the upper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth.       Besides affecting Earth\\'s weather, solar activity gives rise to a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged particles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth\\'s magnetic field, they collide with air molecules above our planet\\'s magnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are known as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.       Satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) out in space play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. These watchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. Continuous global monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and contributes to a better understanding of Earth\\'s complex weather systems.       From their unique vantage points, satellites can survey Earth\\'s oceans, land use and resources, and monitor the planet\\'s health. These eyes in space have saved countless lives, provided tremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our planet in dangerous ways.        The Moon       The Moon is Earth\\'s single natural satellite. The first human footsteps on an alien world were made by American astronauts on the dusty surface of our airless, lifeless companion. In preparation for the human-crewed Apollo expeditions, NASA dispatched the automated Ranger, Surveyor and Lunar Orbiter spacecraft to study the Moon between 1964 and 1968.       NASA\\'s Apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials and data. Six two-astronaut crews landed on and explored the lunar surface between 1969 and 1972, carrying back a collection of rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms (842 pounds) and consisting of more than 2,000 separate samples.       From this material and other studies, scientists have constructed a history of the Moon that includes its infancy. Rocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4.0-4.3 billion years old. The first few million years of the Moon\\'s existence were so violent that few traces of this period remain. As a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into different kinds of rock, the Moon was bombarded by huge asteroids and smaller objects. Some of the asteroids were as large as Rhode Island or Delaware, and their collisions with the Moon created basins hundreds of kilometers across.       This catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four billion years ago, leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge, overlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken rock. Heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to melt the interior of the Moon at depths of about 200 kilometers (125 miles) below the surface. Then, for the next 700 million years -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago -- lava rose from inside the Moon. The lava gradually spread out over the surface, flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas that Galileo Galilei, an astronomer of the Italian Renaissance, called maria, meaning seas.       As far as we can tell, there has been no significant volcanic activity on the Moon for more than three billion years. Since then, the lunar surface has been altered only by micrometeorites, by the atomic particles from the Sun and stars, by the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and astronauts. If our astronauts had landed on the Moon a billion years ago, they would have seen a landscape very similar to the one today. Thousands of years from now, the footsteps left by the Apollo crews will remain sharp and clear.       The origin of the Moon is still a mystery. Four theories attempt an explanation: the Moon formed near Earth as a separate body; it was torn from Earth; it formed somewhere else and was captured by our planet\\'s gravity, or it was the result of a collision between Earth and an asteroid about the size of Mars. The last theory has some good support but is far from certain.        Mars       Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar system\\'s prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life. Astronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what appeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface. These observations -- later determined to be optical illusions -- led to the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a system of irrigation canals on the planet. In 1938, when Orson Welles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction classic War of the Worlds  by H.G. Wells, enough people believed in the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic.       Another reason for scientists to expect life on Mars had to do with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet\\'s surface. This phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might support a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months and cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods.       So far, six American missions to Mars have been carried out. Four Mariner spacecraft -- three flying  by the planet and one placed into martian orbit -- surveyed the planet extensively before the Viking Orbiters and Landers arrived.       Mariner 4, launched in late 1964, flew past Mars on July 14, 1965, coming within 9,846 kilometers (6,118 miles) of the surface. Transmitting to Earth 22 close-up pictures of the planet, the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring channels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water. Mariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of 1969 and returned 201 pictures. Mariners 4, 6 and 7 showed a diversity of surface conditions as well as a thin, cold, dry atmosphere of carbon dioxide.       On May 30, 1971, the Mariner 9 Orbiter was launched on a mission to make a year-long study of the martian surface. The spacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift-off, only to find Mars in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that made surface photography impossible for several weeks. But after the storm cleared, Mariner 9 began returning the first of 7,329 pictures; these revealed previously unknown martian features, including evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across the surface, etching river valleys and flood plains.       In August and September 1975, the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft -- each consisting of an orbiter and a lander -- lifted off from Kennedy Space Center. The mission was designed to answer several questions about the red planet, including, Is there life there? Nobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities, but it was hoped that the biology experiments on the Viking Landers would at least find evidence of primitive life -- past or present.       Viking Lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully touch down on another planet when it landed on July 20, 1976, while the United States was celebrating its Bicentennial. Photos sent back from the Chryse Planitia (\"Plains of Gold\") showed a bleak, rusty-red landscape. Panoramic images returned by the lander revealed a rolling plain, littered with rocks and marked by rippled sand dunes. Fine red dust from the martian soil gives the sky a salmon hue. When Viking Lander 2 touched down on Utopia Planitia on September 3, 1976, it viewed a more rolling landscape than the one seen by its predecessor -- one without visible dunes.       The results sent back by the laboratory on each Viking Lander were inconclusive. Small samples of the red martian soil were tested in three different experiments designed to detect biological processes. While some of the test results seemed to indicate biological activity, later analysis confirmed that this activity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet\\'s soil chemistry. Is there life on Mars? No one knows for sure, but the Viking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist there.       The Viking Landers became weather stations, recording wind velocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and pressure. Few weather changes were observed. The highest temperature recorded by either craft was -14 degrees Celsius (7 degrees Fahrenheit) at the Viking Lander 1 site in midsummer.       The lowest temperature, -120 degrees Celsius (-184 degrees Fahrenheit), was recorded at the more northerly Viking Lander 2 site during winter. Near-hurricane wind speeds were measured at the two martian weather stations during global dust storms, but because the atmosphere is so thin, wind force is minimal. Viking Lander 2 photographed light patches of frost -- probably water-ice -- during its second winter on the planet.       The martian atmosphere, like that of Venus, is primarily carbon dioxide. Nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small percentages. Martian air contains only about 1/1,000 as much water as our air, but even this small amount can condense out, forming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around the slopes of towering volcanoes. Local patches of early morning fog can form in valleys.       There is evidence that in the past a denser martian atmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet. Physical features closely resembling shorelines, gorges, riverbeds and islands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet.       Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are small and irregularly shaped and possess ancient, cratered surfaces. It is possible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too close to Mars and were captured by its gravity.       The Viking Orbiters and Landers exceeded by large margins their design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days, respectively. The first to fail was Viking Orbiter 2, which stopped operating on July 24, 1978, when a leak depleted its attitude-control gas. Viking Lander 2 operated until April 12, 1980, when it was shut down because of battery degeneration. Viking Orbiter 1 quit on August 7, 1980, when the last of its attitude-control gas was used up. Viking Lander 1 ceased functioning on November 13, 1983.       Despite the inconclusive results of the Viking biology experiments, we know more about Mars than any other planet except Earth. NASA\\'s Mars Observer spacecraft, to be launched in September 1992, will expand our knowledge of the martian environment and lead to human exploration of the red planet.         Asteroids       The solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic objects that are in orbit around the Sun but are too small to be considered full-fledged planets. These objects are known as asteroids or minor planets. Most, but not all, are found in a band or belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some have orbits that cross Earth\\'s path, and there is evidence that Earth has been hit by asteroids in the past. One of the least eroded, best preserved examples is the Barringer Meteor Crater near Winslow, Arizona.       Asteroids are material left over from the formation of the solar system. One theory suggests that they are the remains of a planet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago. More likely, asteroids are material that never coalesced into a planet. In fact, if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was gathered into a single object, the object would be only about 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) across -- less than half the diameter of our Moon.        Thousands of asteroids have been identified from Earth. It is estimated that 100,000 are bright enough to eventually be photographed through Earth-based telescopes.       Much of our understanding about asteroids comes from examining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of Earth. Asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth are called meteoroids. When a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at high velocity, friction causes this chunk of space matter to incinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor. If the meteoroid does not burn up completely, what\\'s left strikes Earth\\'s surface and is called a meteorite. One of the best places to look for meteorites is the ice cap of Antarctica.       Of all the meteorites examined, 92.8 percent are composed of silicate (stone), and 5.7 percent are composed of iron and nickel; the rest are a mixture of the three materials. Stony meteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much like terrestrial rocks.       Since asteroids are material from the very early solar system, scientists are interested in their composition. Spacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found that the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are separated by very large distances.       Current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids for closer examination. The Galileo Orbiter, launched by NASA in October 1989, will investigate main-belt asteroids on its way to Jupiter. The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini missions will also study these far-flung objects. Scheduled for launch in the latter part of the 1990s, the CRAF and Cassini missions are a collaborative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the federal space agencies of Germany and Italy, as well as the United States Air Force and the Department of Energy. One day, space factories will mine the asteroids for raw materials.        Jupite r       Beyond Mars and the asteroid belt, in the outer regions of our solar system, lie the giant planets of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. In 1972, NASA dispatched the first of four spacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these colossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock. Jupiter was the first port of call.       Pioneer 10, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in March 1972, was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid belt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system. In December 1973, it returned the first close-up images of Jupiter, flying within 132,252 kilometers (82,178 miles) of the planet\\'s banded cloud tops. Pioneer 11 followed a year later. Voyagers 1 and 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned spectacular photographs of Jupiter and its family of satellites during flybys in 1979.       These travelers found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of liquid hydrogen and helium, topped with a colorful atmosphere composed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium. Ammonia ice crystals form white Jovian clouds. Sulfur compounds (and perhaps phosphorus) may produce the brown and orange hues that characterize Jupiter\\'s atmosphere.       It is likely that methane, ammonia, water and other gases react to form organic molecules in the regions between the planet\\'s frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying below. Because of Jupiter\\'s atmospheric dynamics, however, these organic compounds -- if they exist -- are probably short-lived.       The Great Red Spot has been observed for centuries through telescopes on Earth. This hurricane-like storm in Jupiter\\'s atmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet. As a high-pressure region, the Great Red Spot spins in a direction opposite to that of low-pressure storms on Jupiter; it is surrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and are sometimes consumed by it. The Great Red Spot might be a million years old.       Our spacecraft detected lightning in Jupiter\\'s upper atmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to Earth\\'s northern lights at the Jovian polar regions. Voyager 1 returned the first images of a faint, narrow ring encircling Jupiter.       Largest of the solar system\\'s planets, Jupiter rotates at a dizzying pace -- once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds. The massive planet takes almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey around the Sun. With 16 known moons, Jupiter is something of a miniature solar system.       A new mission to Jupiter -- the Galileo Project -- is under way. After a six- year cruise that takes the Galileo Orbiter once past Venus, twice past Earth and the Moon and once past two asteroids, the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into Jupiter\\'s cloud layers and relay data back to Earth. The Galileo Orbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close to Jupiter\\'s large moons, exploring in detail what the two Pioneers and two Voyagers revealed.        Galilean Satellites       In 1610, Galileo Galilei aimed his telescope at Jupiter and spotted four points of light orbiting the planet. For the first time, humans had seen the moons of another world. In honor of their discoverer, these four bodies would become known as the Galilean satellites or moons. But Galileo might have happily traded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs returned by the Voyager spacecraft as they flew past these planet-sized satellites.       One of the most remarkable findings of the Voyager mission was the presence of active volcanoes on the Galilean moon Io. Volcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world other than Earth. The Voyager cameras identified at least nine active volcanoes on Io, with plumes of ejected material extending as far as 280 kilometers (175 miles) above the moon\\'s surface.       Io\\'s pizza-colored terrain, marked by orange and yellow hues, is probably the result of sulfur-rich materials brought to the surface by volcanic activity. Volcanic activity on this satellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the gravitational tug-of-war between Io, Jupiter and the other three Galilean moons.       Europa, approximately the same size as our Moon, is the brightest Galilean satellite. The moon\\'s surface displays a complex array of streaks, indicating the crust has been fractured. Caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like Io, Europa has been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt -- apparently producing a liquid-water ocean. This ocean is covered by an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the cold of space. Europa\\'s core is made of rock that sank to its center.       Like Europa, the other two Galilean moons -- Ganymede and Callisto -- are worlds of ice and rock. Ganymede is the largest satellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets Mercury and Pluto. The satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or ice and the rest rock. Ganymede\\'s surface has areas of different brightness, indicating that, in the past, material oozed out of the moon\\'s interior and was deposited at various locations on the surface.       Callisto, only slightly smaller than Ganymede, has the lowest density of any Galilean satellite, suggesting that large amounts of water are part of its composition. Callisto is the most heavily cratered object in the solar system; no activity during its history has erased old craters except more impacts.       Detailed studies of all the Galilean satellites will be performed by the Galileo Orbiter.        Saturn       No planet in the solar system is adorned like Saturn. Its exquisite ring system is unrivaled. Like Jupiter, Saturn is composed mostly of hydrogen. But in contrast to the vivid colors and wild turbulence found in Jovian clouds, Saturn\\'s atmosphere has a more subtle, butterscotch hue, and its markings are muted by high-altitude haze. Given Saturn\\'s somewhat placid-looking appearance, scientists were surprised at the high-velocity equatorial jet stream that blows some 1,770 kilometers (1,100 miles) per hour.       Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn. Pioneer 11 sped by the planet and its moon Titan in September 1979, returning the first close-up images. Voyager 1 followed in November 1980, sending back breathtaking photographs that revealed for the first time the complexities of Saturn\\'s ring system and moons. Voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in August 1981.       The rings are composed of countless low-density particles orbiting individually around Saturn\\'s equator at progressive distances from the cloud tops. Analysis of spacecraft radio waves passing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely in size, ranging from dust to house-sized boulders. The rings are bright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock.       The rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body ventured too close to Saturn. The unlucky object would have been torn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its interior. Or the object may not have been fully formed to begin with and disintegrated under the influence of Saturn\\'s gravity. A third possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions with larger objects orbiting the planet.       Unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each other, individual ring particles appear to be held in place by the gravitational pull of Saturn and its satellites. These complex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets that make up the major rings.       Radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an AM car radio during an electrical storm were detected by the Voyager spacecraft. These emissions are typical of lightning but are believed to be coming from Saturn\\'s ring system rather than its atmosphere, where no lightning was observed. As they had at Jupiter, the Voyagers saw a version of Earth\\'s auroras near Saturn\\'s poles.       The Voyagers discovered new moons and found several satellites that share the same orbit. We learned that some moons shepherd ring particles, maintaining Saturn\\'s rings and the gaps in the rings. Saturn\\'s 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from images taken by Voyager 2 in 1 981.        Voyager 1 determined that Titan has a nitrogen-based atmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like Earth\\'s in composition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of Mars and Venus. Titan\\'s surface temperature of -179 degrees Celsius (-290 degrees Fahrenheit) implies that there might be water-ice islands rising above oceans of ethane-methane liquid or sludge. Unfortunately, Voyager\\'s cameras could not penetrate the moon\\'s dense clouds.       Continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be converting Titan\\'s methane to ethane, acetylene and -- in combination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide. The latter compound is a building block of amino acids. These conditions may be similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval Earth between three and four billion years ago. However, Titan\\'s atmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit progress beyond this stage of organic chemistry.       The exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassini mission. The Cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will also deploy a probe called Huygens, which will be dropped into Titan\\'s atmosphere and fall to the surface. Cassini will use the probe as well as radar to peer through Titan\\'s clouds and will spend years examining the Saturnian system.        Uranus       In January 1986, four and a half years after visiting Saturn, Voyager 2 completed the first close-up survey of the Uranian system. The brief flyby revealed more information about Uranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from ground observations since the planet\\'s discovery over two centuries ago by the English astronomer William Herschel.       Uranus, third largest of the planets, is an oddball of the solar system. Unlike the other planets (with the exception of Pluto), this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and south poles alternately facing the sun during an 84-year swing around the solar system. During Voyager 2\\'s flyby, the south pole faced the Sun. Uranus might have been knocked over when an Earth-sized object collided with it early in the life of the solar system.       Voyager 2 found that Uranus\\' magnetic field does not follow the usual north-south axis found on the other planets. Instead, the field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet\\'s center, a phenomenon that on Earth would be like having one magnetic pole in New York City and the other in the city of Djakarta, on the island of Java in Indonesia.       Uranus\\' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, with some 12 percent helium and small amounts of ammonia, methane and water vapor. The planet\\'s blue color occurs because methane in its atmosphere absorbs all other colors. Wind speeds range up to 580 kilometers (360 miles) per hour, and temperatures near the cloud tops average -221 degrees Celsius (-366 degrees Fahrenheit).       Uranus\\' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of photochemical \"smog\" believed to be a combination of acetylene, ethane and other sunlight-generated chemicals. Surrounding the planet\\'s atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into space is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as \"electroglow.\"       Approximately 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) below Uranus\\' cloud tops, there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and dissolved ammonia some 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) deep. Beneath this ocean is an Earth-sized core of heavier materials.       Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105 miles) in diameter, orbiting Uranus. The five previously known -- Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon -- range in size from 520 to 1,610 kilometers (323 to 1,000 miles) across. Representing a geological showcase, these five moons are half-ice, half-rock spheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past activity, including faulting and ice flows.       The most remarkable of Uranus\\' moons is Miranda. Its surface features high cliffs as well as canyons, crater-pocked plains and winding valleys. The sharp variations in terrain suggest that, after the moon formed, it was smashed apart by a collision with another body -- an event not unusual in our solar system, which contains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments from large impacts. What is extraordinary is that Miranda apparently reformed with some of the material that had been in its interior exposed on its surface.       Uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; Voyager 2 imaged 11. In contrast to Saturn\\'s rings, which are composed of bright particles, Uranus\\' rings are primarily made up of dark, boulder-sized chunks.        Neptune       Voyager 2 completed its 12-year tour of the solar system with an investigation of Neptune and the planet\\'s moons. On August 25, 1989, the spacecraft swept to within 4,850 kilometers (3,010 miles) of Neptune and then flew on to the moon Triton. During the Neptune encounter it became clear that the planet\\'s atmosphere was more active than Uranus\\'.        Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot, a circular storm the size of Earth, in Neptune\\'s atmosphere. Resembling Jupiter\\'s Great Red Spot, the storm spins counterclockwise and moves westward at almost 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) per hour. Voyager 2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbed the \"Scooter,\" as well as high-altitude clouds over the main hydrogen and helium cloud deck. The highest wind speeds of any planet were observed, up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) per hour.       Like the other giant planets, Neptune has a gaseous hydrogen and helium upper layer over a liquid interior. The planet\\'s core contains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the other gas giants. Neptune\\'s distinctive blue appearance, like Uranus\\' blue color, is due to atmospheric methane.       Neptune\\'s magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet\\'s spin axis and is not centered at the core. This phenomenon is similar to Uranus\\' magnetic field and suggests that the fields of the two giants are being generated in an area above the cores, where the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the electrical properties of a metal. Earth\\'s magnetic field, on the other hand, is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only slightly tilted and offset relative to its center.       Voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of Neptune\\'s rings. Observations from Earth indicated that there were arcs of material in orbit around the giant planet. It was not clear how Neptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from spreading out into even, unclumped rings. Voyager 2 detected these arcs, but they were, in fact, part of thin, complete rings. A number of small moons could explain the arcs, but such bodies were not spotted.       Astronomers had identified the Neptunian moons Triton in 1846 and Nereid in 1949. Voyager 2 found six more. One of the new moons -- Proteus -- is actually larger than Nereid, but since Proteus orbits close to Neptune, it was lost in the planet\\'s glare for observers on Earth.        Triton circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six days. Tidal forces on Triton are causing it to spiral slowly towards the planet. In 10 to 100 million years (a short time in astronomical terms), the moon will be so close that Neptunian gravity will tear it apart, forming a spectacular ring to accompany the planet\\'s modest current rings.       Triton\\'s landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of Io and Miranda. The moon has more rock than its counterparts at Saturn and Uranus. Triton\\'s mantle is probably composed of water-ice, but the moon\\'s crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and methane. The moon shows two dramatically different types of terrain: the so-called \"cantaloupe\" terrain and a receding ice cap.        Dark streaks appear on the ice cap. These streaks are the fallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas and dark, fine-grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers (1 to 5 miles). Triton\\'s thin atmosphere, only 1/70,000th as thick as Earth\\'s, has winds that carry the dark particles and deposit them as streaks on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yet found in the solar system (-235 degrees  Celsius, -391 degrees Fahrenheit). Triton might be more like Pluto than any other object spacecraft have so far visited.        Pluto       Pluto is the most distant of the planets, yet the eccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside Neptune\\'s orbit, where it has been since 1979 and where it will remain until March 1999. Pluto\\'s orbit is also highly inclined -- tilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets.       Discovered in 1930, Pluto appears to be little more than a celestial snowball. The planet\\'s diameter is calculated to be approximately 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles), only two-thirds the size of our Moon. Ground-based observations indicate that Pluto\\'s surface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin atmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet moves away from the Sun. Observations also show that Pluto\\'s spin axis is tipped by 122 degrees.        The planet has one known satellite, Charon, discovered in 1978. Charon\\'s surface composition is different from Pluto\\'s: the moon appears to be covered with water-ice rather than methane ice. Its orbit is gravitationally locked with Pluto, so both bodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other. Pluto\\'s and Charon\\'s rotational period and Charon\\'s period of revolution are all 6.4 Earth days.        Although no spacecraft have ever visited Pluto, NASA is currently exploring the possibility of such a mission.        Comets       The outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a visit to the inner planets. As asteroids are the rocky and metallic remnants of the formation of the solar system, comets are the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only far from the Sun. Most comet nuclei reside in the Oort Cloud, a loose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching perhaps halfway to the nearest star.       Comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are gravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close to the Sun. As a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer planets, the volatile elements of which it is made gradually warm; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner planets, these volatile elements are boiling. The nucleus itself is irregular and only a few miles across, and is made principally of water-ice with methane and ammonia -- materials very similar to those composing the moons of the giant planets.       As these materials boil off of the nucleus, they form a coma or cloud-like \"head\" that can measure tens of thousands of kilometers across. The coma grows as the comet gets closer to the Sun. The stream of charged particles coming from the Sun pushes on this cloud, blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving rise to the comet\\'s \"tails.\" Gases and ions are blown directly back from the nucleus, but dust particles are pushed more slowly. As the nucleus continues in its orbit, the dust particles are left behind in a curved arc.       Both the gas and dust tails point away from the Sun; in effect, the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the Sun. The tails can reach 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) in length, but the total amount of material contained in this dramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase. Comets -- from the Latin cometa, meaning \"long-haired\" -- are essentially dramatic light shows.       Some comets pass through the solar system only once, but others have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close encounter with one of the giant outer planets. These latter visitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return to the inner solar system.       Halley\\'s Comet is the most famous example of a relatively short period comet, returning on an average of once every 76 years and orbiting from beyond Neptune to within Venus\\' orbit. Confirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 B.C. This regular visitor to our solar system is named for Sir Edmond Halley, because he plotted the comet\\'s orbit and predicted its return, based on earlier sightings and Newtonian laws of motion. His name became part of astronomical lore when, in 1759, the comet returned on schedule. Unfortunately, Sir Edmond did not live to see it.       A comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes comparatively close to Earth. Unfortunately, on its most recent appearance, Halley\\'s Comet passed no closer than 62.4 million kilometers (38.8 million miles) from our world. The comet was visible to the naked eye, especially for viewers in the southern hemisphere, but it was not spectacular. Comets have been so bright, on rare occasions, that they were visible during daytime. Historically, comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens and have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky.       The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) spacecraft will become the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and remain in proximity to it as they both approach the Sun. CRAF will observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing sunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and form a coma and tails. Several spacecraft have flown by comets at high speed; the first was NASA\\'s International Cometary Explorer in 1985. An armada of five spacecraft (two Japanese, two Soviet and the Giotto spacecraft from the European Space Agency) flew by Halley\\'s Comet in 1986.        Conclusion       Despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of space through an obscuring atmosphere, scientists of the past had only one body they could study closely -- Earth. But since 1959, spaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our neighbors in space.        We have learned more about our solar system and its members than anyone had in the previous thousands of years. Our automated spacecraft have traveled to the Moon and to all the planets beyond our world except Pluto; they have observed moons as large as small planets, flown by comets and sampled the solar environment. Astronomy books now include detailed pictures of bodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for generations. We are lucky to be alive now to see these strange and beautiful places and objects.       The knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar system has redefined traditional Earth sciences like geology and meteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called comparative planetology. By studying the geology of planets, moons, asteroids and comets, and comparing differences and similarities, we are learning more about the origin and history of these bodies and the solar system as a whole.       We are also gaining insight into Earth\\'s complex weather systems. By seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by investigating the Sun\\'s activity and its influence throughout the solar system, we can better understand climatic conditions and processes on Earth.       We will continue to learn and benefit as our automated spacecraft explore our neighborhood in space. One current mission is mapping Venus; others are flying between worlds and will reach the Sun and Jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments. Future missions are planned for Mars, Saturn, a comet and the asteroid belt.       We can also look forward to the time when humans will once again set foot on an alien world. Although astronauts have not been back to the Moon since December 1972, plans are being formulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the human exploration of Mars and even the establishment of martian outposts. One day, taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a lunar base or a martian colony!',\n",

       " \"Forwarded from John Spencer (spencer@lowell.edu):  There will be two eclipses of Iapetus by Saturn and its rings, in May and July.  Please spread the word!

Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen from Iapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about the rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomy and Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odell of Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my attention.  THERMAL OBSERVATIONS?     To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July   disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,   etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible,   except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3   airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with   a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something   to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.    Jay  and again:    please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet   disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would   be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and   getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a   good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't   think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are   well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One   possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.  jay\",\n",

For instance, a power company in Virginia  recently asked a state commission for permission to sell more lights of various type.  Yet, all of the different fixture that they sold and wanted to sell were bad designs - one that wasted the light.  Thus, you couldn't even buy a good light from them.  In most places, to get a good light, you have to either order it special at high cost or call a store in Arizona.  At some point, society starts to make rules.  Cars have to pass safety tests.   Companies have to meet pollution standards, etc..  There are two ways to achieve this:  educate the public so that they demand good lighting or force code down the lighting companies backs.

The training course will discuss the applications of satellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energy and the environment.  The training course, organised for the benefit of francophone African experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European Space Agency's establishment in Frascati, which is responsible for coordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensing satellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing, selected from 19 francophone countries from northern, western and central Africa, and three regional African centres, will attend the two-week session. The course will focus on remote sensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1 data.  The ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991 with the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar instrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing missions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year 2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the potential of experts using the practical applications of radar remote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy and the environment, with particular emphasis on applications to geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near- coastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.  The education and practical training programme was developed jointly by the United Nations and ESA. The facilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers and information documents for the training course, will be provided by the Agency. Lecturers at the training course will include high-level experts from other European and African organisations active in remote sensing applications. Funds for the training course are being provided by the United Nations    Trust Fund for New and Renewable Sources of Energy; the primary contributor to that Fund is the Government of Italy.\",\n",

But these were miracles of our parent\\'s doing.  For a decade and more the pundits have told us - \"you\\'ve lost it!\"  The \"me\" generation is only living on the accomplishments of the past.       You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We listen in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living history they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell of it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as General Bernie Schriever told of his team\\'s work - and yes struggle - to build this nation\\'s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.       What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand dollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only of that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen. Schriever\\'s ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the best new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and Poseidon ballistic missiles.       Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing.  This event is proof.  To our technological parents: We\\'ve listened to your stories.  We\\'ve caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit.  And we\\'ve learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let me honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus behind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest engineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your insight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated into today\\'s most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.       You told us in the 60\\'s that a new form of launch vehicle - a single stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You advocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are all great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You convinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld its components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a prime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the generation before you - the generation that built transcontinental aviation in the 1920\\'s and 30\\'s - build a little and test a little and Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who started this program for the SDI.       Douglas Aircraft didn\\'t start with a DC-10.  They didn\\'t even start with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a little - even sold a little and made a little money - before they moved on to the next step.  They didn\\'t take a decade or more before putting the first \"rubber on the road.\"  Max Hunter - you didn\\'t take ten years to build Thor, and by God we\\'re not going to take ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable aerospace transportation is real.       We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same team here today but a few years to show through the Strategic Defense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us - launched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about a year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our commitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet Union.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored the importance of our work in bringing about a new international relationship.       But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the framework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the next generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.       We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This summer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the first time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three years a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space rapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And yes - we\\'ll make a little money off it too!       Then - and only then - we\\'ll spend another three years to build a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of space will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the rocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries.  What a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to counter SDI merge to power mankind\\'s next step to the stars!       To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to the final answer.  Robert Goddard\\'s first rockets weren\\'t Saturn V\\'s!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra dollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital system - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the way.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket exhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the world again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks at hand!',\n",

For example, why does the earth\\'s atmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does?  The naive answer is \"photosynthesis\", but this is clearly incomplete.  Photosynthesis by itself can\\'t make the atmosphere oxygenated, as the oxygen produced is consumed when the plants decay or are eaten.  What is needed is photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of the resulting reduced material.  On earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic matter, mostly from oceanic sources.  However, this burial requires continental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slow that most material is consumed before it can be sequestered).  This suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet without continents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulating an oxygen atmosphere.  In particular, an all-ocean planet may have a hard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere.  There is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth\\'s atmosphere has been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least 2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric O2 to weathering in the absence of replenishment.  No convincing feedback mechanism has been identified.

In Japanese, with abstract in English.      This paper reports the optical tracking results of EGS (experimental geodetic satellite) which was launched on August 13, 1986, by NASDA. The EGS optical tracking experiment process and an outline of the Radio Research Laboratory (RRL) optical ground       <---- station are discussed. A star tracking technique for optical equipment calibration and satellite tracking technique for orbit prediction improvement are also described. The accuracy of EGS tracking data obtained by RRL at the request of NASDA is also discussed.

In International Council of Scientific Unions, Middle Atmosphere Program. Handbook for MAP, Vol. 20 5 p Publication Date: Jun. 1986       As the first attempt among MST (mesosphere stratosphere  troposphere) type radars, the MU (middle and upper atmosphere) radar  features an active phased array system. Unlike the conventional large  VHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed  to individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier  feeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast  beam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the  antenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal  division/combination are performed at a low signal level using  electronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna  beam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the  zenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element  is crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful  calibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna  element was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for  this purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to  make a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern  monitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific  satellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna  Monitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400  watts transmitted from the MU radar. The principle of the measurement  and results are discussed. \",\n",
       " 'Press Release No.19-93 Paris, 22 April 1993  Users of ESA\\'s Olympus satellite report on the outcome of their experiments  \"Today Europe\\'s space telecommunications sector would not be blossoming as it now does, had OLYMPUS not provided a testbed for the technologies and services of the 1990s\". This summarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300 participants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held in Seville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).  OLYMPUS has been particularly useful : -      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of        new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small        antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested        data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,        distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few        examples.  -      in opening the door to new telecommunications services        which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-        frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over        Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.  -      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS        received for the first time in Europe, over several months,        high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and        then distributed it to various centres in Europe.  When OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was the world\\'s largest telecommunications satellite; and no other satellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four different payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.  OLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some of the world\\'s largest businesses. Access to the satellite is given in order to test new telecommunications techniques or services; over the past four years some 200 companies and organisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over 100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning organisation.    As the new technologies and services tested by these OLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they then make use of operational satellites such as those of EUTELSAT.',\n",

Thiokol provided me with samples and data on a reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solid motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of  aluminum in the mix.  For example, the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percent Aluminum.  The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure. The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspect some bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you made a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is what you get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in all directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into the voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  The foamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant, so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The major improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is the principal failure mode for solid propellant.  Dani Eder \",\n",

Clarke  Krieger Publishing Company Melbourne, Florida, USA Orig. Ed. 1993 Pre-publication $84.50 ISBN 0-89464-039-9   This text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a technological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the space betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the tlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make such a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized that there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to reach them.     Tracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient, attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of technology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel became feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed than ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that matter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason as the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate reflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and knowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as well as selected events important in developing the idea of extraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological entries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and speculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between simultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal connections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every entry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every spacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This allows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize differences, similarities, and influences.  This text will be of interest to students of astronautical history, and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic diagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and historians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The unique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and very interesting history of the spaceship.  SPECIAL FEATURES  Includes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and fictional  Contains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos contemporary with the subject.  This includes extremely rare illustrations from scarce books and novels, exclusive photos and drawings fromSoviet spacecraft; rare stills from both famous and obscure science fiction films, and unpublished photographs from NASA archives  An index, bibliography, and appendices are included.

       " 'We`ve had the the Great Western, the [ dunno ] and the Great Northern postulated as Brunel`s masterpiece. Keep boxing the compass chaps, you`ll get round to it eventually.  The Great Western was a highly successful transatlantic mail ship, with hybrid sail and steam propulsion. The Great Eastern, which broke the \\'Little Giant\\' financially and otherwise, was a revolutionary leap forward in ship design. A thirty thousand ton all steel vessel, with primary steam propulsion, it was at the time easily the biggest ocean going vessel ever built. Brunel took advantage of the fact that cargo and / or fuel capacity rose with the cube of scale, while drag rose with the square, so a really big ship could steam thousands of miles without coaling.  Unfortunately, there was no real market for such a beast at the time, and it was eventually sold off at scrap values. As another poster said, it then went on to a successful career as a telegraph cable laying ship. It was in fact the only ship of its day capable of laying a transatlantic cable in one go, with the endurance and capacity to carry the huge reel all the way, and the manoeuverabilty to dredge for defective sections. See Arthur C Clarke`s book \"How the World was One\" [ I think that`s right ]  If that`s how the Shuttle goes down in history, as a technical triumph and a financial disaster for the builder, it would not be entirely ignoble, but I doubt if history will be so charitable.

On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire celestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2) swing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.  2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked to the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity from April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay Antenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to 11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.  3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.  4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify the health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment data; long term trend analysis is continuing.  6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the optimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary analysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation index is near the optimal level.  7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument. Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster flushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed during the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.  9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant changes (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.  10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows:         a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts        b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin        c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner        d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees            off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)        e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1        f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within            acceptable range        g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range        h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,            EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS        i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within            acceptable range        j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours            Time To Initiation - 260 hours   GDS (Ground Data Systems):  1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test for the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21 (Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify the flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller (TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement for the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry rates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry Subsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The 10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was not metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS data from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of the TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.   TRAJECTORY       As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as follows:   Distance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU)  Distance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU)  Heliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour  Distance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km  Round Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 seconds   SPECIAL TOPIC',\n",

       " 'The following is what they feed to us..... most has been posted already, but there are a number of items not seen here yet.....  Redesign Activities Update -- Following is the weekly status on redesign, based on information provided by NASA headquarters.  The station Redesign Team (SRT) provided a detailed status report to the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 22.  The day-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City, VA; topics covered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for the space station; science, technology and engineering research; the assessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on management options and operations concepts also were held.  The Design Teams then presented the three options under study:  ¥ Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priest said the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has identified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended and permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability needed to achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable capability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplified Freedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing systems such as the so-called \"Bus-1 spacecraft,\" the orbiter and Spacelab.  The Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedom photo voltaic modules providing 20 kW of power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelab missions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase.  Human Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S. Common Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking ports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter docked to the station are assumed for this phase. Different operation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase.  ¥ Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of Option B activities. Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom-derived option, from initial Research Capability, to Human-Tended Capability, to Permanent Human Presence Capability, to Two Fault Tolerance, and finally Permanent Human Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the baseline program, with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking system, Crew Health Care System and ECLSS, and a major change to the Data Management System.  Initial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree inclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration orbiter-Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic arrays providing 18.75 kW of power.  Human-Tended Capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss segments and the U.S. lab.  Permanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two orbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.  Two Fault Tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the other section of truss with another set of PV modules, thermal control and propulsion systems.  The freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete state with 16 flights.  Three more flights, to bring up the habitat module, a third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would complete the Permanent Human Capability with International stage.  Griffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware would not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived option.  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including program management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization and operations costs, he said.  ¥ Option C - Singe Launch Core Station -- Chet Vaughn presented Option C, the Single Launch Core Station concept.  A Shuttle external tank and solid rocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttle main engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch and jettisoned after ET separation.  The module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000 cubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 \"decks\" connected by a centralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at various places on the circumference of the module to place the international modules, and other elements.  This \"can\" would have two fixed photo voltaic arrays producing approximately 40 kW of power flying in a solar interial attitude.  In his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O\\'Connor said a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on April 26 so that detailed costing of the options can begin.  The next meeting with the Redesign Advisory Committee will be May 3.  Russian Consultants Arrive in U.S. -- A delegation of 16 Russian space experts arrived in the U.S. on April 21 and briefings to the SRT by members of the Russian team began on the 22nd.  The group includes Russian Space Agency General Director Y. M. Koptev, and V. A. Yatsenko, also of the RSA.  Others on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense, the Design Bureau SALYUT, the Institute of Biomedical Problems, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH.  The Russian team briefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system, docking systems, the Proton launch vehicle, Mir operations and utilization, and the Soyuz TM spacecraft.  The Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilities of the Mir space station, and the possible use of Mir and other Russian capabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  They will be available to the SRT through May 5.  Management and Operations Review Continues --  Work continued in the SRT subgroups.  The Management Group under Dr. Walt Brooks is working to develop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a foundation for the transition to development and operations.  Various management options have been developed including:  ¥ Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain of command.  ¥ Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an Associate Administrator.  ¥ Skunk Works/Dedicated Program Office with a small dedicated co-located hand-picked program office.  ¥ Combine Space Station with Shuttle, with the space station becoming an element of the current program.  ¥ Major Tune Up to Current Organization, with current contracts and geographical distribution maintained but streamlined.  The Operations Group under Dr. John Cox is building on the work of the Operations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA-JSC, which had already begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its preliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible.  As part of its work,  the Operations Group has identified teams of agency experts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of assembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testing and ground operations.  What\\'s in the Week Ahead? -- The Design Support Teams will provide a comprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Monday and Tuesday at which point the design will be \"frozen\" to begin the detailed cost assessment.   Also this week, the team will begin preparing for the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee, to be held May 3.  Dr. Shea Steps Down --  Dr. Joe Shea stepped down as director of the Station Redesign Team on April 22 and Bryan O\\'Connor will take over the activities of the team.  Dr. Shea submitted his resignation as assistant deputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serve as a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available to consult with the SRT. Mr Goldin accepted the resignation so that a request from Dr. Shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated.  Key Milestones -- The key dates for the SRT as they are currently being carried on the schedule are:  April 26 Design Freeze on Options for Costing  April 27 Design Support Team Present Selected Options to SRT  May 3 Status report to Redesign Advisory Committee  May 15 Interim report by Redesign Advisory Committee  June 7 Final report to Redesign Advisory Committee ',\n",

       " 'Archive-name: space/probe Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:19 $  PLANETARY PROBES - HISTORICAL MISSIONS      This section was lightly adapted from an original posting by Larry Klaes     (klaes@verga.enet.dec.com), mostly minor formatting changes. Matthew     Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on     Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material     posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).  US PLANETARY MISSIONS       MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed     minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground     stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the     onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in     the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the     Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed     to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a     transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted     from the expression \"R-dot-bar sub n\" (nth smoothed value of derivative     of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations     of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.      MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December     of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a     very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world     with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide     (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).      MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective     shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary     space. Unable to collect the Sun\\'s energy for power from its solar     panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in     solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.      MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and     took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it     flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere     much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from     this preliminary scan that Mars was a \"dead\" world in both the     geological and biological sense.      MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that     planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information     that Venus\\' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times     that of Earth\\'s, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface     of an ocean.      MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work     done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away     the concept of Mars as a \"dead\" planet, first made from the basic     measurements of MARINER 4.      MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket     launcher autopilot failed.      MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to     orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no     other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian     surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once     flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup     images of Mars\\' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.      MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe     did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in     ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,     plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four     Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974     to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed     Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than     thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which     makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.       PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph     the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide     new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new     data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft     had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on     October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.      PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first     U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally     designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead     studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to     36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6     through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,     and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would     have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.      PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER     11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to     study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through     1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever     to do so.      PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER     12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made     the first radar studies of the planet\\'s surface via probe. PIONEER Venus     2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere     in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the     atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the     surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day     probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before     its batteries failed.       RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)      RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They     were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems     left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.      RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an     instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the     launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.     RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the     camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.      RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but     suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,     the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.      RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost     all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon     and drifted off into solar orbit.      RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send     back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact     with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras     did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first     U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.       LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)      LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image     various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO     missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our     understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.     All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were     essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.     probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar     surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.       SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)      The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar     module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the     soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered     in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing     vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was     strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.      Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the     first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images     and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from     SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,     the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored     the Tycho crater region in 1968.       VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)      VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on     a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June     19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse     Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for     Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes     found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of     its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars\\' sky was     pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is     pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the     thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and     boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.      The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran     out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a     weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep     functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command     had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until     further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the     engineers\\' efforts through May of 1983.      An interesting side note: VIKING 1\\'s lander has been designated the     Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the     lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,     D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until     it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.      VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit     on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in     Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its     sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording     one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in     1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut     down on April 12, 1980.      The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.       VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)      VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March     5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched     August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,     1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and     by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare     once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to     outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,     but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.      Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their     satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered     that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and     aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major     surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous     volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.      When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets     and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep     the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive     jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle     is known). Titan\\'s atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas\\' appearance was     startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.     The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,     kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.      VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,     continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly     monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was     found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational     axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on     Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10     satellites and one more ring were discovered.      In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,     including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright     patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were     discovered. Neptune\\'s magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a     canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What\\'s liquid at 38K?)      The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their     on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets     beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the     location of the heliopause.   SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS      Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and     Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:       SOVIET LUNAR PROBES      LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first       craft in solar orbit.     LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.     LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.     ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was       also a test for future Mars missions.     LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images       from surface.     LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.     LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.     ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8       accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were       unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.     LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil        to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in        1972.     LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon\\'s        surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished        with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.     LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in        1976.       SOVIET VENUS PROBES      VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions         lost enroute in 1961.     VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with         VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in         February of 1966. No images were returned.     VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.         Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe         became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.     VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending         through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before         reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles         similar in 1969.     VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet         in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in         1972.     VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the         first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar         mission.     VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982.   VENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.     VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of   planet\\'s surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.     VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian       atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on       to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in       March of 1986.       SOVIET MARS PROBES      MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased       enroute the following year.     ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian       surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.     MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian       surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red       Planet in 1971.     MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander       signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.     MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to       fire, probe went on into solar orbit.     MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in       1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.       probe MARINER 9.     MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.     MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit       with its flyby bus.     PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars\\' largest         moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to         human/computer error.     PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did         enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week         before scheduled Phobos landing.      While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even     interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have     yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,     Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a     Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been     planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now     the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their     space program remains to be seen.   JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS      SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on     January 8 1985, and approached Halley\\'s Comet within about 7 million km     on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to     measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of     which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on     January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth\\'s. The closest     approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The     geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for     a Japanese spacecraft.      During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail     passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby     will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth\\'s radius)), and the third     October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).       HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,     1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten     once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first     lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget     satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to     orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.      The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An     apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists     to lose track of it. Hagoromo\\'s rocket motor fired on schedule on March     19, but the spacecraft\\'s tracking transmitter failed immediately. The     rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt     camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.      Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and     performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth\\'s atmosphere. Hiten     made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,     1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon\\'s surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and     fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into     lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the     approach:   Apoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km  Periapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km  Inclination : 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)  Period  : 4.7 days   PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES      I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three     groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,     and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means     complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your     research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can     add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.      Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it     would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in     order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in     this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date     general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra     background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good     public and university library. Some of the more recently published works     can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market     bookstore.      General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):        J.

Other works and periodicals:      NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space     probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry     these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission     you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study     some of the books listed above.      Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL     GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth\\'s     Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,     SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER     missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the     VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.      More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions     can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and     SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major     newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,     but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events     were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are     affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you     probably know.      Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you     might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space     groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their     periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe     missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,     Pasadena, California 91106 USA.      Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I     personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas     in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from     it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design     team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.       ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into     Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20     Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas     scintillation proportional counters.       CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint     NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian     system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini     is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.     After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA     trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon     arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an     orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens     Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of     Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours     while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the     surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter     continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan     synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and     targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the     mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn\\'s atmosphere,     rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn\\'s     satellites, and characterize Titan\\'s atmosphere and surface.      One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its     surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that     result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These     hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain     down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to     peer through Titan\\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the     surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will     investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.      The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the     first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of     Saturn\\'s satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan     atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan     Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true     nature of Saturn\\'s rings.

The primary objective of the     TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global     observations of the sea level for several years, substantially     increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also     will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.       ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over     its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields     experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for     various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.      Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of     the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from     that planet by sliding over Jupiter\\'s north pole in a gravity-assist     manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted     about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun\\'s south pole     in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its     perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that\\'s right, a solar-studies spacecraft     that\\'s always further from the Sun than the Earth is!      While in Jupiter\\'s neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and     radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see     *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992).

It will scan the entire sky every six months to search      for variations in soft-X-ray emission from sources such as white      dwarfs, cataclysmic variable stars and flare stars. It will also      search nearby space for such exotic objects as isolated neutron      stars and gamma-ray bursters.

SFU is to be launched by ISAS and      retrieved by the U.S. Space Shuttle on STS-68 in 1994.      1994  o Polar Auroral Plasma Physics [May, Delta II rocket]      June, measure solar wind and ions and gases surrounding the      Earth.   o IML-2 (STS) [NASDA, Jul 1994 IML-02]      International Microgravity Laboratory.   o ADEOS [NASDA]      Advanced Earth Observing Satellite.   o MUSES-B (Mu Space Engineering Satellite-B) [ISAS]      Conducting research on the precise mechanism of space structure      and in-space astronomical observations of electromagnetic waves.      1995  LUNAR-A [ISAS]      Elucidating the crust structure and thermal construction of the      moon\\'s interior.       Proposed Missions:  o Advanced X-ray Astronomy Facility (AXAF)      Possible launch from shuttle in 1995, AXAF is a space      observatory with a high resolution telescope. It would orbit for      15 years and study the mysteries and fate of the universe.   o Earth Observing System (EOS)      Possible launch in 1997, 1 of 6 US orbiting space platforms to      provide long-term data (15 years) of Earth systems science      including planetary evolution.   o Mercury Observer      Possible 1997 launch.   o Lunar Observer      Possible 1997 launch, would be sent into a long-term lunar      orbit. The Observer, from 60 miles above the moon\\'s poles, would      survey characteristics to provide a global context for the      results from the Apollo program.   o Space Infrared Telescope Facility      Possible launch by shuttle in 1999, this is the 4th element of      the Great Observatories program. A free-flying observatory with      a lifetime of 5 to 10 years, it would observe new comets and      other primitive bodies in the outer solar system, study cosmic      birth formation of galaxies, stars and planets and distant      infrared-emitting galaxies   o Mars Rover Sample Return (MRSR)      Robotics rover would return samples of Mars\\' atmosphere and      surface to Earch for analysis.

The US uses missile-defense radars, supplemented by a fascinating  quasi-radar operated by the Navy, to do this for satellites in LEO, and  electrooptical systems for objects at altitudes above 5,000 km or so.

       " '\"Space Station Redesign Leader Says Cost Goal May Be Impossible\"  Today (4/6) the Washington Post ran an article with the headline shown above. The article starts with \"A leader of the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned space station said yesterday the job is tough and may be impossible.\" O\\'Connor is quoted saying whether it is possible to cut costs that much and still provide for meaningful research \"is a real question for me.\" O\\'Connor said \"everything is fair game,\" including \"dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the aerospace industry, chopping management of the space station program at some NASA facilities around the country, working closely with the Russian space station Mir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the manned space shuttle fleet.\"  O\\'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options so far, and they are sorting the serious candidates into three categories based on cost.  The Post says O\\'Connor described the design derived from the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe Kathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I listened in on part of O\\'Connor\\'s briefing to the press on Monday, and in one part of the briefing O\\'Connor talked about how the White House wants three options, sorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part of the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has formed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC, modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch Core [\"wingless Orbiter\"] @ JSC. Later, in response to a reporters question, I thought I heard O\\'Connor say the option based on a SSF redesign was a \"moderate\" cost option, in between low & high cost options. Not the \"high cost\" option as Sawyer wrote).  The article goes on to describe the other two options as \"one features modules that could gradually be fitted together in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The other is a core facility that could be deposited in orbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option would use existing hardware from the space shuttle - the fuselage, for example, in its basic structure.\"',\n",

       " 'There is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today\\'s LA Times (Thursday April 15, 1993, p. D1).  I thought I\\'d post it to stir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by saying that I largely agree that the \"Space Age\" in the romantic sense of several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station miss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, \"What\\'s New\" - the weekly physics update we get here on the net - it\\'s clear that the romance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of matter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with its spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things people are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I think, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of nostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our \"mind children\" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but I think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about what we can do *now*.     Anyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...   SPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW  Micheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)  At 35, America\\'s Space Age won\\'t have to suffer through the angst of a midlife crisis.  The reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no longer define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion -dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic rewards.    Space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America\\'s science and technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our technology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion policy.    To be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies for telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes would be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of scientific and industrial innovation is now dead.  .....  Before the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to write an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively supported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion to build space station Freedom alone.  Even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains, Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken public champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much of the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope to the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively implemented did not seem to matter much.  Political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent vision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar space budgets.  Indeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo era is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration with programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.    ......  While the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel Goldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being positioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America\\'s technological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been slashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions its competitiveness agenda.  ......',\n",

       " 'Forwarded from: PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICE JET PROPULSION LABORATORY CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION PASADENA, CALIF. 91109. (818) 354-5011  Contact:  Mary A. Hardin  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993 #1506       Scientists at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the successful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to measure and study chemicals in the Earth\\'s ozone layer.       The April 3 flight from California\\'s Barstow/Daggett Airport reached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took measurements as part of a program established to correlate data with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).         The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to readings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy (ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle Discovery.       \"We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an ongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively involved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three important ways,\" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on the balloon research campaign.         \"There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,\" he continued.  \"The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists, and the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth for those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own right.\"       The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more pieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the mid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring.  Understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps scientists construct more accurate computer models which are instrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.       The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL instruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures ozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere; a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave radiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier transform infrared interferometer which monitors how the atmosphere absorbs sunlight.        Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three- hour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130 kilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground stations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m. Pacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded to separate from the balloon.       \"We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared measurements,\" Margitan explained, \"and we also needed to fly in darkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.\"       It will be several weeks before scientists will have the completed results of their experiments.  They will then forward their data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS scientists.           The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon Facility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a contract from NASA\\'s Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was launched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction and the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.       The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than one-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic meters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with helium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh between 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The scientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds and is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.       The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA\\'s Upper Atmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements Program.                        ',\n",

The Russians are in the Free World now, or at least it would be Politically Correct to contend so.   It will be tough to make DC-X succeed, and to turn it into an operational orbital vehicle.  Doubtless it will fail to meet some of the promised goals.  The reason people are so fond of it is that it\\'s the *only* chance we have now, or will have for a *long* time to come, to develop a launch vehicle with radically lower costs.    There is no Shuttle successor in funded development, NASP is dwindling away, and ALS/NLS/Spacelifter sure as hell aren\\'t gonna knock any zeroes off that $2000-$3000 per pound cost.   Part of the blame for this must be placed on a Shuttle program that consumes many annual billions of the, er, Free World\\'s available space cash.  As you will no doubt hear from many correspondents in the days to come. (-:  DC-X is an attempt to break out of the vicious cycle by keeping development costs low and flying incremental \"X-plane\" hardware. It\\'s been, to my mind, incredibly successful already-- they\\'ve built a complex prototype in under 600 days for under 60 megabucks.  I would have been extremely skeptical that this could be accomplished in 1990s America, never mind flying the thing, getting a successor funded, or building the DC-Y.  I\\'m sure you know well that launch costs are THE basic problem for any expansion of astronautics.  I don\\'t see a realistic  prospect for beating down those costs, for multi-ton payloads, anywhere else.  If the DC flops, it\\'ll be business as usual in space.  The Nineties and the Double-Oughts will look just like the Seventies and Eighties, a prospect too depressing to bear.  (Pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a different direction.  It doesn\\'t lower cost-per-pound but it offers an orbital launch for under ten megabucks.  It\\'s creating its own market for small payloads.)  I read the magazines and I\\'ve attended the last two IAFs. There are plenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems, some of them as good as or better than SSTO.  There is no sign in today\\'s world that any of these designs will be allowed anywhere near an assembly line.  [...deleting some things I\\'m not going to prove tonight...]  Strawman.  Is anybody seriously proposing this?  References, please.  The DC must be developed in the real-world funding climate, which includes a NASA ferociously committed to continuing Shuttle operations, as well as the \"bird in the hand\" argument your common sense tells you.   If DC-Y flies at all, it flies alongside the Shuttle, not instead of it.  Also, of course, DC-Y and its operational descendants will be useful for a wide variety of jobs even if they are *not* man-rated.   If a DC-X successor can fly a 10,000-kg payload for $1M, or even $5M, rather than the $40M it now costs, more people will be able to afford more payloads... for the same money, you can fly several satellites instead of one.  Big outfits can fly multi-satellite series.  Little outfits will be able to fly spacecraft of their own, instead of begging a ride.  This is just supply and demand.  You should be able to convince *yourself* that point 4 will be true, assuming DC makes a big difference in costs.  Do you have some reason to think not?',\n",

Hiermee ontstond de tweede universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste waarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde in de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350 jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.  De huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten sterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht, vieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala aan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een planetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies Natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er staat echter meer op stapel.  Studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het huidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten 'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren. Bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van de stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de eerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren, waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten zullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot het stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op een apart vel. Het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN ZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!  Tijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed gaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht Westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen het heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar, in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren. Prof. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en trachten te verklaren. Het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de technische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn namelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10 miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30 Watt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal er niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse technologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.  Deelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en f 16,- (inclusief lunch). Inschrijving geschiedt door het verschuldigde bedrag over te maken op ABN-AMRO rekening 44.46.97.713 t.n.v. stichting 350 JUS. Het gironummer van de ABN-AMRO bank Utrecht is 2900. Bij de inschrijving dient te worden aangegeven of men lid is van de NNV. Na inschrijving wordt de symposiummap toegestuurd. Bij inschrijving na 31 maart vervalt de mogelijkheid een lunch te reserveren.  Het symposium vindt plaats in Transitorium I, Universiteit Utrecht.

I don\\'t know what a \"low grade\" fusion reactor is, but the major problem with 3He (aside from the difficulty in making any fusion reactor work) is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just so small -- on the order of 5 ppb or so, on average (more in some fractions, but still very small).  Massive amounts of regolith would have to be processed.  This thread reminds me of Wingo\\'s claims some time ago about the moon as a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn\\'t content with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth\\'s crust, average) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though the market price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound. This prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.  On the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; \"high-Ti\" basalts (Apollo 11 and 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but... terrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in titanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, and sometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are *enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the world (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  If even 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2 at concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti basalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon could be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the ore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being mined today).',\n",

On April 22 and 23, delta Differenced One-way Range (DOR) passes were performed over DSS-14/63 (Goldstone/Madrid 70 meter antennas) and DSS-14/43 (Goldstone/Canberra 70 meter antennas), respectively.  Initial results  indicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to ground station hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed.  2.  On April 23, a cruise science Memory Readout (MRO) was performed for the Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.  Analysis indicates the data was received properly.  3.  On April 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the spacecraft stored sequence.  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS (Command Data Subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to preclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being a source of internal electrostatic charge (IESD).  4.  On April 26, cruise science Memory Readouts (MRO) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  5.  During the period from April 26 to April 27, a navigation cycle was performed.  This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of two-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the spacecraft over DSS-63, DSS-14, and DSS-43.  6.  On April 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay Antenna (RRA) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28. The RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately 20.3 degrees.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18 degrees which was well within the predicted range.  The RRA was commanded back to approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had increased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.       After verifying proper RRA slewing, the RRA slew test mini-sequence was uplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink, a Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator on May 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also, a DAC was sent to turn the Two-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test mini-sequence.  7.  On April 27, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.  8.  On April 28, the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft under stored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees from stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees, back to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All of the slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was at 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4 degrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews, real-time commands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.  9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 17 DN (3.9 volts).  The DC measurement reads 134 DN (15.7 volts).  These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.  10. The Spacecraft status as of April 29, 1993, is as follows:         a)  System Power Margin -  75 watts        b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin        c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner        d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 23 degrees            off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)        e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1        f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within            acceptable range        g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range        h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,            EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS        i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within            acceptable range        j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours            Time To Initiation - 203 hours   GDS (Ground Data Systems):  1.  The first Galileo-GDS test of the MGDS V18.0 Command System (CMD) took place April 27, 1993 with DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna).  The test went well and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN (Deep Space Network) Group 5 Command Processor Assembly (CPA).  The test was successful and the next test for V18.0 CMD is scheduled for May 1, 1993 with DSS-15 (Goldstone 34 meter antenna).  2.  The April System Engineers Monthly Report(SEMR)/Ground System Development Office (GSDO) MMR was conducted Thursday, April 29.   A review of current Project and Institutional (DSN and MOSO) system status was conducted.  On-going cruise development plus the GSDO Phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules, past months accomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed.  No significant schedule changes or significant problems were reported.

Many of the topics recently discussed on sci.space are covered in this.  Gibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance  Dr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station.  A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee. Each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development, operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.  Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the President\\'s new technology investment. As a result, station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.  Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee. Generally, the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted. They also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider.  Gibbons also announced that the United States and its international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give \"full consideration\" to use of Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.  To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology. The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilities. Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal.  Gibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents. However, he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\"',\n",
       " \"  Well it rolled out two weeks ago. As we speak it is at White Sands getting ready. I would have called my sources for the latest but they are all out of town (in NM).  As for the future, there is at least $5M in next years budget for work on SSRT. They (SDIO) have been looking for more funds and do seem to have some. However, SDIO is not (I repeat, is not) going to fund an orbital prototype. The best we can hope from them is to 1) keep it alive for another year, and 2) fund a suborbital vehicle which MIGHT (with major modifications) just make orbit. There is also some money for a set of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.  Better news comes from the new Spacelifter effort. The USAF managers of this program are very open to SSTO and will have about $50M next year for studies. This would be enough to bring DC-Y to PDR.  Now not all of this money will go to DC but a good case could be made for spending half on DC.  Public support is STILL critical. Meet with your Congressperson (I'll help you do it) and get his/her support. Also call your local media ans get them to cover the flight tests.     Allen\",\n",

Indications were that the spacecraft had entered a Fault Protection mode sometime between that time and receipt of normal telemetry at the end of the previous station pass (DSS-15 - Goldstone 34 meter antenna) at approximately 8:00 PM the evening before.  Entry into Contingency Mode was verified when signal was reacquired and telemetry indicated that the spacecraft was sun coning.  After subsystem engineers reported all systems performing nominally, fault protection telemetry modes were reconfigured and memory readouts of command system Audit Queue and AACS (Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem) Starex performed.  These readouts verified that Contingency Mode entry occurred shortly after 1:30 AM yesterday, 4/29/93.  Preliminary indications are that a Sun Ephemeris Check failure triggered fault protection.  However, the Flight Team will be determining the precise cause over the next few days.  As of last evening, the spacecraft had been commanded back to Inertial Reference and was stable in that mode.  The Flight Team is planning to command the spacecraft back to Array Normal Spin state today.',\n",

The hobby has been flourishing from early 1980s and is becoming increasing popular. Technically this is not consider amateur rocketry.  Any rocket with a liftoff weight greater than 3.3 pounds OR using a total impulse of G or greater, REQUIRES an FAA waiver to launch. Typically, a group of people get an FAA waiver for specified period of time (ie week, weekend, etc.) at a designated site and time, and all of the launches are then covered under this \"blanket waiver\". There is also a \"High Power Safety Code\" which designates more specific rules such as launch field size, etc.  Finally, in order to purchase any of the larger (Class B) rocket  motors you need to certified through either the National Association of Rocketry or Tripoli Rocketry Association.

The rockets you describe are called HPR, or high power rockets, to distinguish them from (smaller) model rockets. They use factory-made ammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engines with graphite nozzles. The engines are classified by impulse. A \"D\" engine, for example, can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse. An \"F\" engine can have no more than 40 ns. Each letter corresponds to a doubling of the maximum impulse. So far, engines up to size \"O\" are available pretty much off the shelf. Engines of size H and above are shipped as Class B explosives, and as such are controlled. Engines of size F and below are shipped as Class C explosives, and are not as controlled. Class F engines, BTW, are not HPR engines, but model rocket engines. (Class G engines go in and out of legal limbo.)  There is an HPR Society, The Tripoli Rocket Society, I believe, which holds events at various sites throughout the year, with all legalities (FAA waiver included) taken care of. The National Association of Rocketry is more concerned with engines below H, though it is involved in HPR as well. These societies certify users of HPR rockets, and companies will not sell to uncertified individuals.  Bottom Line: It\\'s legit.

       " '  The company was probably \"Public Missiles, Inc\" of Michigan.   Yup.   Nope, it\\'s not illegal. It is, however, closely regulated. In order to  purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be one of the following: a) An employee of a government agency. b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets. c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in research or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations:  The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry. Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.  The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any  organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions  to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are: - Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the location, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL.  - The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft within the operating radius around the launch site. - Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited. - The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that unmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.  Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year) are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the western deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular since it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).  The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members\\' use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is from 50 to 500 or more feet.   By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an \"F\" motor are exempt from most Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart C, for details.  As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to 50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical rocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute, or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry either a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches in the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.  Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.   Why not? It\\'s a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets for information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything bigger) rocket hobbies.

April 6, 1993  RELEASE:  93-64          Dr.  John H.  Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station.          A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development, operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.          Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the President\\'s new technology investment.  As a result, station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.          Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider.          Gibbons also announced that the United States and its international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give \"full consideration\" to use of Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.          To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes. Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal.          Gibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\"          NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian participation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science Center at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.',\n",

       " \" Jonathan, interesting questions.  Some wonder whether or not the moon could have ever supported an atmosphere.  I'd be interested in knowing what our geology/environmental sciences friends think.  As for human tolerances, the best example of human endurance in terms of altitude (i.e. low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure) is in my opinion to the scaling of Mt. Everest without oxygen assistance. This was accomplished by a team of mountaineers who trained at high altitudes for quite awhile (I think a few months) and then were flown by helicopter from that training altitude to the equivalent altitude on Mount Everest, where they began the ascent of our planet's highest peak without oxygen tanks.  This is quite a feat of physiological endurance, because if you or I tried to go to 20,000 feet and exert ourselves, we would probably pass out, get altitude sick, and could even die from cerebral edema. So this is the limit of low pressure.  High pressure situations would be limited by the duration of time which it takes to slowly acclimate to a higher pressure.  Skin divers would know alot about high pressure situations and could tell you about how they safely make deep dives without getting the bends.  Some military experiments have put people under several atmospheres of pressure (not sure what the high limit was because the papers aren't in front of me).  Usually at a certain point, the nitrogen in the air becomes toxic to the body and you start acting idiotic.  Divers call this nitrogen narcosis.  Those afflicted can do very dangerous and irrational things, like taking off a diving mask and oxygen tank in order to talk to fish at 100 feet under water.  (Hope any diving folk can elaborate on this matter, as I am not a diving expert).  Mars cannot support human life without pressurization because the atmosphere is too thin (1/100 th  our Earth's atmospheric density).  In addition, the Mars atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide.  Basically, you would need a  pressure suit there, or you'd die from the low pressure.  Interesting huh?\",\n",

So, having seen Henry's encouraging statement about starting to talk about it; I shall.  I feel that we as a community of people have unique resources to deliver to the world a comprehensive book which can elaborate on the utility of spaceflight to fields which are as divergent  as medical intensive care, agriculture, environmental protection, and  probably more.  I do not believe that the general public understands the impact of spaceflight on the whole of society.  In the absence of such knowledge, we see dwindling support of the world's space effort.  I believe that we as a group have the responsibility to not only communicate amongst ourselves, but also with others through print media.  A well-orchestrated and technically oriented analysis of life science variables required to support long-duration spaceflight (like long expenditions to the moon or Mars) would be entertaining and educational to the general public.  The objective of such an effort would be to  compile resources and publications from accepted scientific and technical journals which would address each major life science area.  In addition, ideas for further research and development could be put forward for the general public to ponder...allowing the general public to take part in the excitement of exploration.  Individuals interested should be willing to devote an hour per week to running literature searches and finding journal articles.  In addition, we need to obtain the assistance of personnel from within the halls of NASA and industry.  I have appreciated the positive responses to date and I am personally eager to start this project.  Perhaps we could start with debate regarding how best to grade the viability of various technologies for application to spaceflight.\",\n",

Why is the general public going to be interested in the technical details of long term space habitation?  I like the idea of the study, but it should be released to other scientists and engineers who will be able to use it. If you want a general public document, you'll need a more general publication.   As one working on Controlled Ecological Life Support Systems, engineering the microworld isn't the problem.  The problem is understanding the basic chemical, biological and medical factors to be able to engineer them efficiently.  For example, the only way we know how to produce food is from plants and animals.  Food synthesis is not very far advanced.  So we have to orbit a farm.  Well that's obviously not very efficient, so we use  technology to reduce the mass and grow plants hydroponically instead of  using dirt.  This is where the engineering comes in.  But new technologies bring new basic questions that we don't have the answers to.  Like, in  dirt we can grow tomatoes and lettuce right beside each other, but in  hydroponics it turns out that you can't do that.  The lettuce growth is  stunted when it's grown in the same hydroponic solution as tomatoes.  So  now you have to consider what other plants are going to have similar interactions.  This means some basic applied scientific research.  And that's what needs to be done with all technologies that have been developed so far. We also need to find out how they interact together.  That's where we are now.   First you need to do the literature search.  There is a lot of information out there.  Maybe we should just pick a specific area of long term habitation. This could be useful, especially if we make it available on the net.  Then we can look at methods of analyzing the technologies.   Unless there is an unbelievable outpouring of interest on this on the net, I think we should develop a detailed data base of the literature search  first.  Then if we accomplish that we can go on to real analysis.  The data base itself could be useful for future engineers.  That's my response Ken, what do you think?\",\n",

I think that this forum can make a major change in that lack of insight and education.  All of us, in our own way, can contribute to a comprehensive document which can be released to the general public around the world.  The document would scientifically analyze the technical aspects of long term human habitation in space.  I believe that if any long-term space exploration program is to  succeed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld (i.e. the spacecraft).  Only through the careful analyses of engineering, chemical, biological, and medical factors will a good ecosystem be created to facilitate human life on a long-duration flight.  So, I would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective methods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies which can be applied to long-duration spaceflight.  Such a detailed literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocates and clearly important to existing space programs.  In essence, we would be dividing the space life science issues into various technical problems which could be solved with various technologies. This database of acceptable solutions to various problems could form the basis of detailed discussions involving people from the bionet, isunet, and any other source!\",\n",

For example, is : >there a constant sensation of falling?   Ron Baalke (baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) replied: : Yes, weightlessness does feel like falling.  It may feel strange at first, : but the body does adjust.  The feeling is not too different from that : of sky diving.  I\\'m no astronaut, but I\\'ve flown in the KC-135 several times.  I\\'ll tell you about my first flight.  At the on-set of weightlessness, my shoulders lifted and my spine straightened.  I felt a momentary panic, and my hands tried to grab onto something (like the strap keeping me firmly against the floor) to prevent me from falling; I remember conciously over-ruling my involuntary motions.  My ears felt (not heard) a rush and I could feel fluid moving in my head (like when you get up from bed while you have a cold).  At that point, I ceased to concentrate on my physiological response, since I had some science to do.  I was busy keeping my experiment going and keeping track of all the parts during the \"return\" of gravity and subsequent 1.8-G pull-out, so I didn\\'t really pay attention to physiology at that time.  After about 5 parabolas, I discovered that I was performing one of the tricks I\\'ve discovered to keep myself from getting motion sickness; I was keeping my head very still and moving very slowly -- all except my hands and arms, which needed to be in rapid, concious motion for my experiment.  During the pull-out to parabola 5, my queasiness finally started to get to me, and I had to use one of those air-sickness bags.  I was basically useless for the rest of that flight, so I went to the seats in the back of the plane while my partner (whom I drafted for just this purpose) kept working on the experiment while I was ill. (He was a vetran Vomit Comet rider, one of those anomalous people who don\\'t get sick on the thing.)  I didn\\'t think of it as a \"constant sensation of falling\" so much as like swimming in air.  It\\'s very close to the sensations I feel when I\\'m scuba diving and I turn my head down and fins up.  Jerry: : >And what is the motion sickness : >that some astronauts occasionally experience?   Ron: : It is the body\\'s reaction to a strange environment.  It appears to be : induced partly to physical discomfort and part to mental distress. : Some people are more prone to it than others, like some people are more : prone to get sick on a roller coaster ride than others.  The mental : part is usually induced by a lack of clear indication of which way is : up or down, ie: the Shuttle is normally oriented with its cargo bay : pointed towards Earth, so the Earth (or ground) is \"above\" the head of : the astronauts.  About 50% of the astronauts experience some form of : motion sickness, and NASA has done numerous tests in space to try to : see how to keep the number of occurances down.

Since my note taking ability is by no means infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is  granted to copy this without restriction.  Michael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an informal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois. ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and International Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the company is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that his daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.  The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga to visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king, who happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which  the king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million, His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought there probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous satellite slots.  While this isn\\'t entirely off the wall, it was very unusual, seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of slots.  The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl Hilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions supporting Tonga\\'s case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from  70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside). According to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and  the Pacific Rim.   RIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax haven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately $2 billion.  It\\'s not easy to raise that kind of money. Eventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began  negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in  Moscow in such harsh terms that I don\\'t think I\\'ll visit there for a long time. Besides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way that people operate.  For example \"everybody can sell you everything.\"   Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.  Eventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost of $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg says that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who  went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was out of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He again described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually, he worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the  Russian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions before signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to  allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.  The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied  Mechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in  Siberia (can\\'t figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that siberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest people who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians and midwesterners :-)  Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is  apparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that would sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them  specifications, they\\'ll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites that RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This compares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1 million compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their  satellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They  have the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give you their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are getting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place now.  Tidbits:  *  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big business because big business is just like what they have over there, except that \"we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.\"  *  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch within 9 months.  *  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement fund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia, and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.  *  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried partly because we aren\\'t used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying monolith.  Italy gets a new government \"every two weeks\" but we don\\'t worry  because we\\'re used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what really goes on in Russia we won\\'t worry about their stability as much.  *  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering money.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting 25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the \"equivalent\" value in  rubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian bank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled by the government.  *  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western  satellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites, which was rather reassuring.  *  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have a lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare well with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much  shorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the  difference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition, shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date hardware. ',\n",
       " ' Wishful thinking mostly. It\\'s more likely that the Moon will never be the site of major commercial activity.

Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch,  and it\\'s position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it\\'s heat  sink capacity could offer some military utility for \"high ground\" military weapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space  travel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as  Mt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that\\'s a very minor  activity in the global scope of things.  Luna has an inconvienent gravity field. It\\'s likely too low to prevent calcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it\\'s too high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories that can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital sites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink, and shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and heavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity wells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.  We don\\'t use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually ignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That\\'s because we don\\'t have to deal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more expensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we\\'ll use the easier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few centuries, if not much longer.  Luna\\'s main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio astronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site of a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for defending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument. The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good enough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for conventional warfare again.

You need special FAA authorization, but provided you aren\\'t doing it under one of the LAX runway approaches or something stupid like that, it\\'s not especially hard to arrange.  As with model rocketry, this sort of hardware is reasonably safe if handled properly.  Proper handling takes more care, and you need a lot more empty air to fly in, but it\\'s basically just model rocketry scaled up.  As with model rocketry, the high-power people use factory-built engines, which eliminates the major safety hazard of do-it-yourself rocketry.',\n",

I know that sats are capable of photographing the license plates of vehicles.  My question is this:  The camp in question was taken out by the British SAS.  And while the SAS was in action, the CIA team was watching in the warroom back in Langley, VA.  The action of the SAS was clear and appeared to be relayed via a sat.  The action was at night and the photography appeared to be an x-ray type.  That is, one could see the action within the tents/structures of the camp.

To the North Pole!          On June 2 and 7, 1983, two of the Soviet Union\\'s mighty PROTON      rockets lifted off from the Tyuratam Space Center in the Kazakhstan      Republic.  Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe      for the planet Venus.           Designated VENERA 15 and 16, the probes were meant not for landing     yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the     planet in detail from orbit.  To accomplish this task, the basic     VENERA design was modified in numerous areas.  The central bus core     was made one meter (39.37 inches) longer to carry the two tons of     propellant required for braking into orbit, double the fuel carried by     the VENERA 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier.  Extra solar panels     were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large     amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging.  The     dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger      to properly transmit this information to Earth.           Atop the buses, where landers were usually placed, were installed     the 1.4 by 6-meter (4.62 by 19.8-foot), 300-kilogram (660-pound)     POLYUS V side-looking radar antennae.  The radar system, possibly a     terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by      the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance, would be able to map Venus\\'     surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers (0.62 to 1.2 miles).           The Soviet probes\\' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over     the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter, which could reveal objects      no smaller than 75 kilometers (45 miles) in diameter.  And while the     VENERAs\\' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations      made by the 300-meter (1,000-foot) Arecibo radio telescope on the      island of Puerto Rico, the orbiters would be examining the northern     pole of Venus.  This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or      PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially      interesting geological features worthy of investigation.          On October 10, 1983, after an interplanetary journey of 330      million kilometers (198 million miles) and two mid-course corrections,      VENERA 15 fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a      polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometers (600 by 39,000 miles) around      the planet, completing one revolution every twenty-four hours.  VENERA      16 followed suit four days later.  The twin probes thus became Venus\\'      first polar-circling spacecraft.          Radar operations began on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20      for VENERA 16.  For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north     pole, the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers      (ninety miles) wide and nine thousand kilometers (5,400 miles) long.       The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over      the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back      to two large Soviet antennae on Earth.  Each strip of information took      eight hours to process by computer.  By the end of their main missions      in July of 1984, the VENERAs had mapped 115 million square kilometers      (46 million square miles), thirty percent of the entire planet.          VENERA 15 and 16 revealed that Venus has a surface geology more     complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late 1970s.  Numerous hills,      mountains, ridges, valleys, and plains spread across the landscape,      many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the      last one billion years.  In planetary terms this makes the Venerean      surface rather young.  Hundreds of craters were detected as well, the      largest of which had to have been created by meteorites (planetoids      would be a better term here) at least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles)      across, due to Venus\\' very dense atmosphere.          There were some disagreements between U.S. and Soviet scientists     on the origins of certain surface features.  For example, the probes\\'      owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the      summit of 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high Maxwell Montes, the tallest      mountain on the planet, was the result of a meteorite impact.  American      scientists, on the other hand, felt the crater was proof that Maxwell      was a huge volcano sitting on the northern \"continent\" of Ishtar Terra.            In any event, the U.S. decided to wait on making verdicts about     Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe, scheduled for later     in the decade.  Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar     (VOIR), its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig-     nated the Venus Radar Mapper (VRM).  Eventually the machine would be      called MAGELLAN, after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan      (circa 1480-1521).  This vehicle would map the entire planet in even      finer detail than the VENERAs.  For the time, however, the Soviet      probes maintained that distinction.          Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs.  Bolted     next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the      Fourier infrared spectrometer, the latter for measuring the world\\'s     temperatures.  The majority of the areas covered registered about     five hundred degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit), but a few     locations were two hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating      current volcanic activity.  The probes also found that the clouds      over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles)      lower than at the equator.  In contrast, the polar air above sixty      kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty degrees      warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights.          When the main mapping mission ended in July of 1984, there were      plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at      more southernly latitudes.  Unfortunately this idea did not come to      pass, as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control     gas to perform the operation.            VENERA 15 and 16 ceased transmission in March of 1985, leaving      the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six      hundred kilometers (360 miles) of radar data tape to sort into an      atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus.          Venus by Balloon          For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting      target to scientists who wished to explore the planet\\'s mantle of      air with balloon-borne instruments.  Professor Jacques Blamont of      the French space agency Centre National d\\'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)     had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967, only to have a joint      French-Soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982.  Nevertheless,      late in the year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true.          When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December 15 and 21,      the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear, full      views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe      since 1975.  This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission.          The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named     VEGA 1 and 2, a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI - Gallei     being the Russian word for Halley.  Not only did the spacecraft      have more than one mission to perform, they also had more than one      celestial objective to explore, namely the comet Halley.            This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to      the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910.     Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from     the formation of the solar system five billion years ago, scientists      around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such      bodies which actually come close to Earth.            Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar      system.  Some, like Halley, are perturbed by various forces and fall      in towards the Sun, where they circle for millennia spewing out ice      and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar      encounter.          The Soviet Union, along with the European Space Agency (ESA) and     Japan\\'s Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), did not     wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a     close examination of Halley.  The ESA would be using the cylindrical     GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the      comet, while Japan\\'s first deep space craft - SAKIGAKE (Pioneer) and      SUISEI (Comet) - would view Halley from a much safer distance.           Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet     from the vantage of a space probe, at one time envisioning a vessel     powered by solar sails or ion engines.  However, government budget     cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts.  The U.S. would have to     make do primarily with Earth-based observations and the sharing of      data from other nations, though an instrument named the Dust Counter      and Mass Analyzer (DUCMA), designed by Chicago University Professor      John Simpson, was added on the Soviet mission in May of 1984.          The Soviets\\' answer to Halley were the VEGAs.  Instead of building     an entirely new craft for the mission, the Soviets decided to modify     their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an      advanced Venus mission along the way.  As VEGA 1 and 2 reached Venus,     the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of      the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley, much as the      U.S. probe MARINER 10 used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier.      The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley, helping to pinpoint the      location of the comet\\'s erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive      in only 605 kilometers (363 miles) away in March of 1986.          As planned, the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of 1985.  VEGA     1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month, the lander     making a two-day descent towards the planet.  The craft touched the     upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11.  Sixty-one kilometers     (36.6 miles) above the Venerean surface a small container was released     by the lander, which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers (33 miles)     altitude.  Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had     successfully arrived.           One kilometer after the opening of the parachute, helium gas was     pumped into the Teflon-coated plastic balloon, inflating it to a     diameter of 3.54 meters (11.68 feet).  Dangling on a tether thirteen     meters (42.9 feet) below was the instrument package, properly known as     an aerostat.  The top part of the 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat     consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment     point to the balloon.  Beneath it was the transmitter, electronics,     and instruments.  Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for     measuring cloud particles.  The aerostat was painted with a special     white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which     permeated the planet\\'s atmosphere.           The VEGA 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just     north of the equator.  Scientists were concerned that the gas bag      would burst in the heat of daylight, so they placed it in the darkened      hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data.       This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as      well, effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions.       The author wonders, though, if they could have used floodlights similar      to the ones attached to VENERA 9 and 10 in 1975, when Soviet scientists      had thought the planet\\'s surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight      due to the permanently thick cloud cover.          The first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day     hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed, covering 11,600     kilometers (6,960 miles).  The threat of bursting in the day heat did     not materialize.  The VEGA 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer     (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers     (thirty miles), for this was considered the most active of the three     main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in 1978.  Indeed the     balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers     (150 miles) per hour.  Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and     down two to three hundred meters (660 to 990 feet) through most of the     journey.  The layer\\'s air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius     (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and pressure was a mere 0.5 Earth atmosphere.     The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds.           Early in the first balloon\\'s flight, the VEGA 1 lander was already     headed towards the Venerean surface.  Both landers were equipped with     a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA 13      and 14 in 1982.  However, VEGA 1 would become unable to report the     composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia, the     Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra.  While still ten to fifteen     minutes away from landing, a timer malfunction caused the drill to      accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6      miles) above the surface.           There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before     touchdown nor reactivate it after landing.  This was unfortunate not     only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of     Venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never      before been directly examined.  Nevertheless, the surface temperature      and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees Celsius (874.4 degrees      Fahrenheit) and 95 Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander\\'s      56 minutes of ground transmissions.  A large amount of background      infrared radiation was also recorded at the site.          As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA 11 and      12 had failed in December of 1978, the Soviets focused on the data     returned during the lander\\'s plunge through the atmosphere.  The     French-Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur, chlorine,      and possibly phosphorus.  It is the sulfur - possibly from active      volcanoes - which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color.     The Sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air     between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers (28.8 and 37.8 miles)     contained one milligram (0.015 grain) of sulfuric acid.          The VEGA 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks      appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS.     The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 2\\'s results     nearly matched its twin.  The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers      instead of the three reported by the U.S. probes.  The layers were      three to five kilometers (1.8 to 3 miles) thick at altitudes of 50      and 58 kilometers (30 and 34.8 miles).  The clouds persisted like a     thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers (21 miles),      much lower than the PV readings.  One possibility for the discrepan-     cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air      over the last seven years.          When the lander and balloon finally went silent, the last      functioning part of the VEGA 1 mission, the flyby bus, sailed on     for a 708 million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around     the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley.  On March     6, 1986, the bus made a 8,890-kilometer (5,334-mile) pass at the      dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space.     The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial     bodies with one space vessel.          On June 13, VEGA 2 released its lander/balloon payload for     a two-day fall towards Venus.  Like its duplicate, the VEGA 2     balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking     it on Earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning     side of the planet.  During its 11,100-kilometer (6,660-mile)     flight over Venus, the second balloon entered in a rather still     environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission.     After 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent      for a further eight hours.  When the balloon passed over a five-     kilometer (three-mile) mountain on the \"continent\" of Aphrodite      Terra, a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers (1.5      miles) towards the surface.          Temperature sensors on the VEGA 2 balloon reported that the air      layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees Celsius      (43.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than the area explored by the VEGA 1     balloon.  This was corroborated by the VEGA 2 lander as it passed      through the balloon\\'s level.  No positive indications of lightning     were made by either balloon, and the second aerostat\\'s nephelometer      failed to function.          The VEGA 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite     Terra\\'s western arm on the fifteenth of June, 1,500 kilometers (900     miles) southeast of VEGA 1.  The lander\\'s resting place was smoother     than thought, indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a     relatively young one covered in fresh lava.  The soil drill was in     working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite,      rare on Earth but present in Luna\\'s highlands.  This rock is rich in      aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium.  A high degree      of sulfur was also present in the soil.  The air around VEGA 2 measured      463 degrees Celsius (865.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 91 Earth atmospheres,     essentially a typical day (or night) on Venus.          Far above the VEGA 2 lander, its carrier bus sped past Venus at     a distance of 24,500 kilometers (14,700 miles) and followed its twin      to comet Halley, making a closer flyby on March 9, 1986 at just 8,030      kilometers (4,818 miles).  Both probes helped to reveal that the comet      is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers      (8.4 miles) across, rotating once every 53 hours, give or take three      hours.          Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley     encounters, Soviet scientists considered an option to send the      probes to other celestial objects.  One prime target was the near-     Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis, which VEGA 2 could pass at a distance      of six million kilometers (3.6 million miles).  Sadly, the Soviets      had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly      a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was      not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned.       VEGA 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987.          Future Plans Diverted          The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous      ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second      world from the Sun.  One example was the VESTA mission, planned for     the early 1990s.          This Soviet-French collaboration called for the launch of multiple      probes on a single PROTON rocket in either 1991 or 1992.  The craft      would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon      probes.  The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet\\'s      corrosive atmosphere for up to one month, a large improvement over      the VEGA balloons\\' two days.  The mission would then head out to      investigate several planetoids and comets, including a possible      landing on Vesta (thus the mission name), the most reflective Main      Belt planetoid as seen from Earth.          Unfortunately for Venus exploration, plans began to change in     the Soviet Union.  In 1986 the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA     mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus, keeping the comet     and planetoid aspects intact.  By this time in the Soviet space      program interest was focusing on Mars.  Already under construction      was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS.  Two members of this      class were planned to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next      year.  PHOBOS 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on     Mars\\' largest moon, Phobos.           All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions,     including balloon probes, rovers, soil sample return craft, and      eventually human explorers in the early Twenty-First Century.     The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious     consideration of human colonization in the near future.          But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars     exploration.  Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions,     one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in 1988 and the other     going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon     landing in March of 1989.           In 1989 a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to     ten penetrators around the planet in 1998.  Several years later the     mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put      on indefinite hold.  No other official Soviet missions to Venus have     since been put forth, a sad commentary after twenty-five years of     continuous robotic exploration of the planet.           During the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change     was taking over the Soviet Union.  President Mikhail Gorbachev began      to \"open up\" his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with      the rest of the nations, particularly those in the West.  While the      culture became less oppressive than in the past, the economy was taking      a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a \"free market\".          These effects hit everywhere, including the space program.     Missions at all levels were cut back.  The Soviets began making     almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring     nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to      make money.            In early 1992 it was reported that the Soviets were offering for      sale several fully-equipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price      of 1.6 million dollars each, an incredibly low price for any planetary      probe.  No nation took them up on the bargain.  Meanwhile the United      States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own.          MAGELLAN and GALILEO           The U.S. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration     with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May 4, 1989.     Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft, a combination of     spare parts from other U.S. probes designed to make the most      detailed and complete radar-mapping of Venus in history.  When     MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of 1990, it would be     able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108     meters (360 feet), surpassing the abilities of VENERA 15 and 16.          In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space      Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit      the giant planet Jupiter in 1995.  On October 18, 1989, the Shuttle      ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space,      named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the      probe\\'s primary target\\'s major moons in 1610.          In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on     a direct flight to the Jovian planet, the probe was sent around     Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach     Jupiter.  As a result, Venus became GALILEO\\'s first planetary     goal in February of 1990.  The probe radioed back images of the     planet\\'s swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in     that violent atmosphere.          On the Drawing Boards          With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years,     new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus.  Scien-     tists in the U.S. have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet      Union - now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January 1,      1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions      within in the next decade.  Japan, India, and the ESA have also     considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades.          In February of 1993 NASA came up with several new Venus projects      as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes     throughout the solar system.  For Venus two missions were selected     for further study:  A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing     of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds, air     temperature, and pressure; and the Venus Composition Probe, designed     to study Venus\\' atmosphere while descending through the thick air     with the aid of a parachute, much as the Soviets had done since 1967.     Final project decisions will be made in 1994.          Humans on Venus                Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus?     At present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure     would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something     even tougher than a VENERA lander.  Plans have been looked into     changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like     Earth\\'s.  However, it should be noted that any such undertaking     will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide      atmosphere, a major reduction in surface heat, and the ability      to speed up the planet\\'s rotation rate to something a bit faster     than once every 243 Earth days.  Such a project may take centuries     if not millennia.          In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand     Venus as its exists today.  We still have yet to fully know how     a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became     instead such a deadly place.  Will Earth ever suffer this fate?     Perhaps Venus holds the answers.  Such answers may best be found     through international cooperation, including the nation which      made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus.

Mitchell                           March 23, 1993   INTRODUCTION:   In order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a real miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test tele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals located world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment purposes. Not only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and tele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of information on methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of a lunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating educational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in Twenty-First century remote learning methods.   Because of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests and skills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures, interfacing and electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving playground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and professionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at a participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at the LTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real facility exists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the construction of the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested by the users themselves.   This has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:  - tele-operations and virtual reality research  - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation  - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers  - art and theater  - bbs and online network users  - software and game developers  - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains  - children  - the child in all of us   LTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:   A room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used for murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth. The \"floor\" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions is hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and creation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and machine-lets.    The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:  1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;  2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and  3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.    Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on  it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture  content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent  to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.   The first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains with TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will receive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their data link to LTM1.   Next, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a servo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the SSTO to be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar landscape and land.   Finally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped bulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators worldwide to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and takeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on commercially available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced ham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.   By taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding a tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be provided in under 80 man hours.   PLAN OF ACTION:   The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by providing a host computer network and Internet access to that network. Diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction of the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be modified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide \"rail stock\" for the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical communications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets. An initial \"ground breaking\" with miniature shovels will be performed for a live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial models will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for historical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely serious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional building, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and the photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution world-wide to major online networks and bbs\\'s. A press release will be issued calling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale models for the simulated lunar colony.   A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then be announced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of the lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that time the results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will then be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return to their campus.   A monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via conventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media. Having a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo opportunity for the television community. Especially since the \"action\" will be controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be invited to issue \"challenges\" to engineering and human factors students at universities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform lunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.   The long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education, experimentation and remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a long term global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited to space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!   CONCLUSION:   EduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a globally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation purposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create world-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require real (not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people\\'s minds in space.

So a large car with a good Cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with a poorer Cd.   To calculate drag use this formula:  D = 1/2 * rho * v^2 * Cd * S  Where D is the drag force (lbs), rho is the local air density (slugs/ft^3), V is the velocity (ft/s), and S is the frontal area (ft^2).  Note that the pieces called 1/2 * rho * v^2 are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressure (a fancy aero term for air pressure or force).   Note that power is:  P = F * v  Where P is power (lbf-ft/s), F is the force, drag in this case (lbf) and v is velocity (ft/s).   Note that if you put the whole equation into one (by substituting D for force) you get a velocity _cubed_ term.  That's why huge increases in power result in little increases in speed.  Ditto for decreases in Cd.   So if you have a 100 mph car and reduce Cd from .34 to .33, your new top speed is:  (sound of trumpet fanfare)  101 mph  Sorry to dissappoint.  \",\n",

But if you ask me for specific justifications other than the increased resource base, I can't give them.  We just don't know enough.

For much of the \\'20\\'s, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the industry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired and Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point where long-distance flights became practical.

They profits from the voyage would then be shared.

The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft), Orteig\\'s prize, Lord Northcliffe\\'s prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in 1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required were within the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were well within the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.

I wonder if there might be some way of structuring a contest to encourage low cost payload delivery systems.  The accounting methods would probably be the hardest to work out.  For example, would you allow Rockwell to 'loan' you the engines?  And so forth...   This depends on the how soon the new launch system comes on line.  In other words, perhaps a great deal of worthwhile technology (life support, navigation, etc.) could be developed prior to a low cost launch system.

       " \"     I don't remember the formula's off hand as it has been awhile since I took aerodynamics and haven't used the stuff since.  The Cd is related to the drag force which is what effects top speed and fuel consumption. When the drag force on the car or aircraft is greater than what the vehicle's engine can overcome it has reached its top speed. (autos of course also have to overcome rolling resistance) Since drag opposes the vehicle's motion, the engine must make up for that by burning more fuel. Anyway, since the geometery of an auto is rather complex, the Drag,pressure coeffiecent,etc is either found experimentaly, or using a numerical method.  anyway for flow around a cylinder the drag coeff is:              Cd = d/(q*2R)         where d is the drag force, q the flow velocity and R is the radius of the clyinder.    To get a rough (very rough) estimate, you can set R at 1/2 the car's width, q at the car's speed and knowing the Cd, find the drag force that the car would need to overcome.  \",\n",

It has never worked in any large scale project that it was ever tried on. Could you imagine a Reston like set up for  Apollo?   Oh you are full of it Allen on this one.

I agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successful large scale effort. What I completly disagree with is seperating that integration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called leadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for the success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership and responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up as Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC and they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to finally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.  There is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that for a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the turn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of leadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a symptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your efforts that you do not see this.   No, I am saying that if they were located at JSC it never would have  happened in the first place.

All to put a single man on the moon for a year.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of delivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone have a more precise guess about how much a year's supply of consumables and equipment would weigh?  And I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded to burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled?  Henry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10 engines.  Aren't they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1?  I've forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the DC-1.  All in all, I'm not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the moon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first non-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned moon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from lunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find some way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal might result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared to win.  And for those that didn't give up, I find something a little scary about a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I'd like to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.  Lastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an English space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on the cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human body produced, how much lunar material it'd need for protection from solar flares, etc.  Unfortunately I don't remember the name of this magazine.  Does this ring a bell to anyone?\",\n",

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS      Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints     have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on     microfilm.      The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it     is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960\\'s vintage hardware (like     guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB     have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch     from.      By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify     the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean     sheet design.       WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN\\'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE      Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access     for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an     opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being     \"scooped\" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently     releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early     in a mission.       RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES      There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to     block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium     thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in     worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental     reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.     Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2     RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather     satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months     with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar     module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which     was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in     the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are     expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10     half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].

IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER      From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from     the Space Shuttle\\'s Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible     for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies     indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in     absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The     remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted     study, Charles Jackman.      The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the     stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was     organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space     Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia     (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space     Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and     Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects     of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.      The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:         Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year    Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year    Shuttle sources:   725,000 kilograms/year      The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are     launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the     total stratospheric chlorine sources.      The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would     be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability     associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.      The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed     by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally     averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and     Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch     schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be     increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about     the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons     do at the present time.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE      If you *don\\'t* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a     minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your     breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to     watch out for when ascending, and you\\'ll have eardrum trouble if your     Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal     experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no     immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do     not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.      Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly \"the bends\", certainly some     [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)     start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from     lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,     you\\'re dying. The limits are not really known.

Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School     of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.       HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED      The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is     a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.     What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank     came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the     astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin     team\\'s medical/forensic report.      The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the     water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks     underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team     examined them, they were sent off to be buried.       USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT      You can\\'t use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit     because it can\\'t get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry     enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.      Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of     that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in     the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly     specialized for travel between Earth\\'s surface and low orbit. Taking it     higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would     be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit     spacecraft.      [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]       THE \"FACE ON MARS\"      There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid     face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:     35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often     published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13     (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).      Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is     artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an     extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the     resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a     smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere     on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don\\'t     know the address) to study the Face.      The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution     camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this     question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is     best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or     sci.astro.      V. DiPeitro and G.

The whole question of \"a right to a dark sky\" revolves around the definition of a right.  Moral rights and natural rights are all well and good, but as far as I can see, a right is whatever you or someone representing you can enforce.  In most civilizations, the government or the church (or both) defines what the rights of the citizens are, and then enforces those rights for them.  Here in the U.S., the constitution provides a \"Bill of Rights\" from which most if not all legal rights are considered to derive.  I\\'m sure that most other countries have comparable documents.  If you can persuade a court that you have a right to a dark sky derived in some manner from the Bill of Rights (in the U.S.), you can prevent (maybe) these billboards from being launched.

At this point,  many congresspersons have been approached about the bill. However, for a successful effort to pass the bill, we need the best possible congressperson to introduce the bill. Due to his position as Chair of the House Committee on Space and Science, Congressman George Brown is the logical choice. He has a long record of support and interest in space development, and helped pass the Launch Services Purchase Act and the Space Settlements Act.                               There is a small group of activists in southern California  who have assisted George Brown in his recent re-election campaigns. We are mobilizing this group to have them tell Congressman Brown about the Back to the Moon bill. We are also asking pro-space constituents to let him know that they care about getting America back to the Moon.         Finally, there is a good chance that a nationwide alert  for space activists to call or write George Brown to have him introduce the Back to the Moon bill may be staged during late spring, 1993.         All this should produce a positive reaction from Brown's office. As more is known, it will be passed on.         However, even if we are successful in getting him to support the bill,  this alone will not ensure passage of the bill. For any bill to become law, one of three conditions must exist: either the bill must reflect widespread national support for an issue (such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits); be propelled by high-priced lobbyists (we're out of luck there); or have widespread support within Congress, due to small, but widespread, constituent support. The latter is the path that we, by necessity, must choose.                             This means that the introduction of the Lunar Resources  Data Purchase Act must be immediately accompanied by a large number of congresspersons' sponsorship of the bill.  To accomplish this, we need activists to ask their congressperson to support the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act - now. To wait until the bill is introduced is simply too late - it takes time to have a congressperson's staff review a bill.         If your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet introduced, please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently written.

It would            violate the \"laws\" of physics.  All of the \"experts\" and            \"authorities\" said so.                            For example, Simon Newcomb declared in 1901:  \"The            demonstration that no possible combination of known            substances, known forms of machinery and known forms of            force, can be united in a practical machine by which man            shall fly long distances through the air, seems to the writer            as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any            physical fact to be.\"                            Fortunately, a few SMART people such as the Wright            Brothers did NOT accept such pronouncements as the final            word.  Now we take airplanes for granted, (except when they            crash).                            Today, orthodox physicists and other \"scientists\" are            saying similar things against several kinds of \\'Free Energy\\'            Technologies, using negative terms such as \"pseudo-science\"            and \"perpetual motion\", and citing so-called \"laws\" which            assert that \"energy cannot be created or destroyed\" (\"1st law            of thermodynamics\") and \"there is always a decrease in useful            energy\" (\"2nd law of thermodynamics\").  The physicists do not            know how to do certain things, so they ARROGANTLY declare            that those things cannot be done.  Such PRINCIPLES OF            IMPOTENCE are COMMON in orthodox modern \"science\" and help to            cover up INCONSISTENCIES and CONTRADICTIONS in orthodox            modern theories.                            Free Energy Inventions are devices which can tap a            seemingly UNLIMITED supply of energy from the universe, with-           OUT burning any kind of fuel, making them the PERFECT            SOLUTION to the world-wide energy crisis and its associated            pollution, degradation, and depletion of the environment.                            Most Free Energy Devices probably do not create energy,            but rather tap into EXISTING natural energy sources by            various forms of induction.  UNLIKE solar or wind devices,            they need little or no energy storage capacity, because they            can tap as much energy as needed WHEN needed.  Solar energy            has the DIS-advantage that the sun is often blocked by            clouds, trees, buildings, or the earth itself, or is reduced            by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and            high latitudes.  Likewise, wind speed is WIDELY VARIABLE and            often non-existent.  Neither solar nor wind power are            suitable to directly power cars and airplanes.  Properly            designed Free Energy Devices do NOT have such limitations.                            For example, at least three U.S. patents (#3,811,058,            #3,879,622, and #4,151,431) have so far been awarded for            motors that run EXCLUSIVELY on permanent MAGNETS, seemingly            tapping into energy circulating through the earth\\'s magnetic            field.

They typically have a \\'SPARK GAP\\' in the circuit            which serves to SYNCHRONIZE the energy in the coils with the            energy being tapped.  It is important that the total            \\'inductance\\' and \\'capacitance\\' of the Device combine to            \\'RESONATE\\' at the same frequency as \\'EARTH RESONANCE\\' in            order to maximize the power output.  This output can also be            increased by centering the SPARK GAP at the \\'NEUTRAL CENTER\\'            of a strong U-shaped permanent magnet.  In the case of a            Tesla Coil, slipping a \\'TOROID CHOKE COIL\\' around the            secondary coil will enhance output power.  [\"Earth Energy:            Fuelless Propulsion & Power Systems\", by John Bigelow, 1976,            Health Research, P.O. Box 70, Mokelumne Hill, CA  95245.]                            During the 1930\\'s, an Austrian civil engineer named            Viktor Schauberger invented and partially developed an            \\'IMPLOSION TURBINE\\' (German name, \\'ZOKWENDLE\\'), after            analyzing erosion, and lack of erosion, in differently shaped            waterways, and developing sophisticated mathematical            equations to explain it.  As described in the book \"A            Breakthrough to New Free-Energy Sources\", by Dan A. Davidson,            1977, water is pumped by an IMPELLER pump through a            LOGARITHMIC-SPIRAL-shaped coil of tubing until it reaches a            CRITICAL VELOCITY.  The water then IMPLODES, no longer            touching the inside walls of the tubing, and drives the pump,            which then converts the pump\\'s motor into an ELECTRIC            GENERATOR.  The device seems to be tapping energy from that            of the earth\\'s rotation, via the \\'Coriolis effect\\', LIKE A            TORNADO.  [ It can also NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY! ]                            A fourth type of Free Energy Device is the \\'McClintock            Air Motor\\' (U.S. Patent #2,982,261), which is a cross between            a diesel engine (it has three cylinders with a compression            ratio of 27 to 1) and a rotary engine (with solar and            planetary gears).  It burns NO FUEL, but becomes self-running            by driving its own air compressor.  This engine also            generates a lot of heat, which could be used to heat            buildings; and its very HIGH TORQUE makes it ideal for large            trucks, preventing their slowing down when climbing hills.             [David McClintock is also the REAL original Inventor of the            automatic transmission, differential, and 4-wheel drive.]                            Crystals may someday be used to supply energy, as shown            in the Star Trek shows, perhaps by inserting each one between            metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of            particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a            common household smoke detector.                            One other energy source should be mentioned here,            despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of Free            Energy.  A Bulgarian-born American Physicist named Joseph            Maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic FUSION            reactor which he calls \\'Migma\\', which uses NON-radioactive            deuterium as a fuel [available in nearly UNLIMITED quantities            from sea water], does NOT produce radioactive waste, can be            converted DIRECTLY into electricity (with-OUT energy-wasting            steam turbines), and can be constructed small enough to power            a house or large enough to power a city.  And UNLIKE the            \"Tokamaks\" and laser fusion MONSTROSITIES that we read about,            Migma WORKS, already producing at least three watts of power            for every watt put in.  [\"New Times\" (U.S. version), 6-26-78,            pages 32-40.]                            And then there are the \\'cold fusion\\' experiments that            have been in the news lately, originally conducted by            University of Utah researchers B. Stanley Pons and Martin            Fleischmann.  Some U.S. Navy researchers at the China Lake            Naval Weapons Center in California, under the direction of            chemist Melvin Miles, finally took the trouble to collect the            bubbles coming from such an apparatus, had them analyzed with            mass-spectrometry techniques, and found HELIUM 4, which            PROVES that atomic FUSION did indeed take place, and enough            of it to explain the excess heat generated.                            There are GOOD INDICATIONS that the two so-called \"laws\"            of thermodynamics are NOT so \"absolute\".  For example, the            late Physicist Dewey B. Larson developed a comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he            calls the \\'Reciprocal System\\', (which he describes in detail            in several books such as \"Nothing But Motion\" (1979) and \"The            Universe of Motion\" (1984)), in which the physical universe            has TWO DISTINCT HALVES, the material half and an anti-matter            half, with a CONTINUOUS CYCLE of matter and energy passing            between them, with-OUT the \"heat death\" predicted by            thermodynamic \"laws\".  His Theory explains the universe MUCH            BETTER than modern orthodox theories, including phenomena            that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about, and is SELF-CONSISTENT in every way.  Some            Free Energy Devices might be tapping into that energy flow,            seemingly converting \"low-quality energy\" into \"high-quality            energy\".                            Also, certain religious organizations such as \\'Sant Mat\\'            and \\'Eckankar\\' teach their Members that the physical universe            is only the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major levels of            existence, like parallel universes, or analogous to TV            channels, as described in books like \"The Path of the            Masters\", by Dr. Julian Johnson, 1939, and \"Eckankar: The Key            to Secret Worlds\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, 1969.  For example,            the next level up from the physical universe is commonly            called the \\'Astral Plane\\'.  Long-time Members of these groups            have learned to \\'Soul Travel\\' into these higher worlds and            report on conditions there.  It seems plausible that energy            could flow down from these higher levels into the physical            universe, or be created at the boundary between them, given            the right configuration of matter to channel it.  This is            supported by many successful laboratory-controlled            experiments in PSYCHO-KINESIS throughout the world, such as            those described in the book \"Psychic Discoveries Behind the            Iron Curtain\".                            In terms of economics, the market has FAILED.  Inventors            do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop            and mass-produce Free Energy Equipment, and the conventional            energy producer$ have no desire to do so because of their            VE$TED INTERE$T$.  The government is needed to intervene.  If            the government does not intervene, then the total supply of            energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and            will soon run out, prices for energy will increase, and            pollution and its harmful effects (including the \\'GREENHOUSE            EFFECT\\', acid rain, smog, radioactive contamination, oil            spills, rape of the land by strip mining, etc.) will continue            to increase.                            The government should SUBSIDIZE research and development            of Free Energy by Inventors and universities, subsidize            private production (until the producers can make it on their            own), and subsidize consumption by low-income consumers of            Free Energy Hardware.                            The long-range effects of such government intervention            would be wide-spread and profound.  The quantity of energy            demanded from conventional energy producer$ (coal mining            companie$, oil companie$ and countries, electric utilitie$,            etc.) would drop to near zero, forcing their employees to            seek work elsewhere.  Energy resources (coal, uranium, oil,            and gas) would be left in the ground.  Prices for            conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero,            while the price of Free Energy Equipment would start out high            but drop as supply increases (as happened with VCR\\'s,            personal computers, etc.).  Costs of producing products that            require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease,            along with their prices to consumers.  Consumers would be            able to realize the \"opportunity costs\" of paying electric            utility bills or buying home heating fuel.  Tourism would            benefit and increase because travelers would not have to            spend their money for gasoline for their cars.  Government            tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be            obtained in some other way.  AND ENERGY COULD NO LONGER BE            USED AS A MOTIVE OR EXCUSE FOR MAKING WAR.                            Many conventional energy producer$ would go out of            business, but society as a whole, and the earth\\'s environment            and ecosystems, would benefit greatly.  It is the People,            that government should serve, rather than the big            corporation$ and bank$.

       " \" In fact, you probably want to avoid US Government anything for such a project.  The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in hassles.  The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically down in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any new problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km -- the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course, you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns and beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.  The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for more than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit. For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper might be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting money in a big way.  Given this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a minor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which dominates the cost of the project.\",\n",
       " \"  According to this reasoning there are no rights, at least none that I can think  of....  Let's see.  Do I have a right to unpolluted air?  No, because the majority drive cars and use goods that create air pollution in the manufacturing process.  Do I have the right to clean water?  I guess not, by the same reasoning. I could go on with these examples for a long time....  Look at Nazi Germany.  Because of the majority, Jews, homosexuals, blacks, and others that were different had no rights.  In fact they were terrorized,  imprisoned, and slaughtered.  In this country did blacks have the right to be free from slavery?  I guess not, because the majority said that slavery was  good for them.  I think that a right has a moral imperative.  If a law, imposed by the majority, is immoral, one should not follow it.  In fact, one should do everything in his/her power to stop it. Of course, that doesn't mean that I would lose all common sense to break the law, just because I thought it was immoral.

The beauty and wonder takes your breath away.  Now imagine you live in the worst ghetto, say in L.A. Due to light pollution you have never seen a dark sky.  You might in fact never, not in your whole life, ever see the majesty of the night sky.  Every where around you, you see squalor, and through your life runs a thread of dispair. What is there to live for?    I admit these two scenarios are extreme examples, but I have seen both. I, for one, need dreams and hopes, and yes, beauty, as a reason for living.

       " \"   There was an interesting article in Scientific American some time ago about breathing liquid. (It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out.) As far as I can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid:   - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out      of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own     breathing effort (let alone anything else)    - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is     expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled     is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)     So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done     by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen     tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough     oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.    - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough     gas per unit volume.

       " 'In the April edition of \"One Small Step for a Space Activist\", Allen Sherzer & Tim Kyger write:   \"Another problem is what are called \\'wraps\\' (or sometimes    the \\'center tax\\'). When work for a large program like    Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the    center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts    to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the    center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to    be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about    that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10    billion won\\'t be spent on anything having anything    to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion    was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn\\'t), but the work done    with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting    the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the    existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the    term \\'center tax\\'. They look at the Station they are    getting and the price they are paying and note that    it doesn\\'t add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware    that a third of the money is going for something else.\"  My dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple of weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, I talked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station at Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn\\'t post a response immediately, I do have a real job I\\'m supposed to be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHz data & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low on the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend in Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers  Association conference, extolling the virtues of SSF to 15,000 science teachers.]  First off, yes, the concept of \\'center tax\\', or \\'wrap\\' does exist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total \\'tax\\' for the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million. This was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4 center \\'taxes\\'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at $2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is 04/2.2 = 1.8%  Over the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30 billion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to $540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but I will concede it\\'s still an appreciable amount of pocket change.  I should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could be close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds that are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some states, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat the food at the restaurant, but you don\\'t if you get it take-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds we receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT* subject to the center tax (I don\\'t have the numbers in front of me, but I\\'d guess at least 95% of the WP-4 funds go to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax rate of 1/3, but it\\'s only applied to funds spent at the center, and not to the prime contracts.  This leads to the obvious question \"What is the government doing with SSF funds that don\\'t go to the prime contractors? (i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A big portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens to the balance of the funds, which aren\\'t eaten up by the center tax?)\"  At WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting development funds (as they are supporting the development work done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to setup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical power system architecture. Our testbed has a real life solar array field (left over from solar cell research research a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries (to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC switchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated loads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent change evaluation involving concerns about the stability of the power system.  We have also used the supporting development money to purchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life testing at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in Indiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on test recently hit the four year life test milestone. 38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the on-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).  As a final example, my \\'home\\' division at Lewis used the supporting development funds to purchase personal computers and work stations, for performing system analyses (like modeling of the performance of the electrical power system, availability calculations using a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a  database with information on weight of the power system elements).  Finally, the money raised by the \\'tax\\' does not all go into a \\'slush fund.\\' At Lewis, the director does control a small discretionary fund. Each year, any individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to the director to get money from this fund to look at pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.  Most of the tax, however, goes to fund the \\'general\\' services at the Center, like the library, the  central computer services division, the Contractor  who removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather difficult to determine what percentage of the SSF budget doesn\\'t go for SSF activities. To get an accurate figure, you would have to take the annual expenditure for the library (for example), and then divide by the amount of the library funds used to support SSF (which would be hard to compute by itself - how would you figure out what percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for 1 year is \\'billable\\' to SSF, would you base it on the person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week versus the rest of the center personnel). You would then have to compare this estimate of the SSF portion of the library expense with the portion of the tax that goes to support the library. Who knows, maybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but we underpay for snow removal? Talk about a burecratic nightmare!',\n",

       " \"  Dennis, I have worked on or written proposals worth tens of millions of $$. Customers included government (including NASA), for profit and non-profit companies. All expected a wrap (usually called a fee). Much of the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractors. The subcontractors where universities, for-profits, non-profits, and even some of the NASA Centers for the Commercialization of Space. ALL charged fees as part of the work. Down the street is one of the NASA commercialization centers; they charge a fee.  Now, I'm sure your a competent engineer Dennis, but you clearly lack experience in several areas. Your posts show that you don't understand the importance of integration in large projects. You also show a lack of understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it is reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything. This isn't a flame, jsut a statement.  Your employer DOES charge a fee. You may not see it but you do.    Well there you are Dennis. As I said, they simply include the fee in their overhead. Many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can change depending on the customer.   Integration, Dennis, isn't overhead.   Dennis, Reston has been the only NASA agency working to reduce costs. When WP 02 was hemoraging out a billion $$, the centers you love so much where doing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem. Reston was the only place you would find people actually interested in solving the problems and building a station.   When you have a bit more experience Dennis, you will realize that integration isn't overhead. It is the single most important part of a successful large scale effort.   The story you refer to said that some NASA people blamed it on Congress. Suprise suprise. The fact remains that it is the centers you support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldn't address the problems until the press published the story.  Are you saying the Reston managers where wrong to get NASA to address the overruns? You approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns?   You should know Dennis that NASA doesn't include transport costs for resuply. That comes from the Shuttle budget. What they where saying is that operational costs could be cut in half plus transport.   I do hope you can find the time to tell us just why it was wrong of Reston to ask that the problems with WP 02 be addressed.    Allen \",\n",

What are the Vida> main problems associated with too many long-haul (over 4 hours) Vida> trips?  The crew rest requirements are to prevent undue fatigue.  The cockpit crew (pilot) limits are somewhat more stringent than the cabin crew limits for this reason.  Crew rest requirements address amount of time on duty plus rest time.  A tired crew is an accident-prone crew.  The only limits I know of for inner-ear problems are in military aircraft, which are frequently unpressurized or less reliably pressurized.  Not being able to clear the ears renders aircrew members DNIF (duties not involving flying) or grounded until the ears clear.  Flying can accentuate problems if ears don't clear.  If you don't have big pressure changes, you may not know that you've got a problem.  But if you zip up to 5,000 or 6,000 ft (the usual cabin altitude in an airliner) and then back down to sea level, you may discover a problem. Ears don't clear readily because of allergies, colds, infections, and anatomical problems.  The last won't change; the first three can. Medication (decongestants or antihistimines, usually) can help.

       " 'ETHER IMPLODES 2 EARTH CORE, IS GRAVITY!!!    This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary,  ether sucking structures, AND why we observe \"orbital\" motion!!    Ether, the theoretical propogation media of electro-magnetic  waves, was concluded not to exist, based on the results of the  Michelson-Moreley experiment conducted a century ago.     I propose that those conclusions are flawed, based on the fact  that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the  earth\\'s surface, not perpindicular. (Due to the prevailing assumption  that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)    The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the  development of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications  of BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!    REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!     1   I dream like this: ether based reality     The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations  start as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices both drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it,  converting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy.  (non-spinning lattice = \"dark matter\")    The earth isn\\'t exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image  of a galaxy; we haven\\'t any videos of them spinning. Picture us  being stationary, and the sun\\'s image being dragged across the sky by  the spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is  spinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner  kernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a  faster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground  of the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but  its \"foot print\" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])      The moon isn\\'t exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self  spin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth\\'s ether field, which is  itself in the sun\\'s much more powerful field. Our seasons are the  wobble of earth\\'s axis, like a top slowing down. The \"orbit\" of the earth around the sun is all of the stars\\' images being dragged around by the sun\\'s ether feild.    The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and \"distance\"  apart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because  the \"path\" is not the same. The moon\\'s lattice in the ether is like  sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half  turn. The sun\\'s lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has  got the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to  the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a \"j\" hook at  the end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the  whole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there.     With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon  can be about as big as \"earth\\'s\" shadow upon it, and at other times  totally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge,  would you guess that they are about the same size, just because they  look about the same size?     O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S  E       /     \\\\                 M    |      |      OR                M              \\\\ _ _ /                                 S                                      The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate of ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating \"turntable view\"  of the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I\\'ve seen a  half moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the  day. Try and draw that \"earth shadow.\") Its only the moon\\'s image  which appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is  the part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away  from the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.    \"Light-Years\" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is  closer to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase  of reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion.  (defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be  essentially happening now. The \"piece\" of light may have experienced  many years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.    To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to  de-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design  a propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like  trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)    To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I\\'d  look in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just  might carry decipherable data. I\\'d start looking on some part of the  spectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+  billion humans?) I\\'d totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG  backwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card  for Pentium!)    Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound  media, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I  would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which  I\\'d start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole.  [Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a  two foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I  could get with my machine\\'s receiver next to it.      If you don\\'t think you\\'ll live to see it, consider this: QUIT  PUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of  life\\'s data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our  thoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By  eating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant  instructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or  biblical guys did live hundreds of years. I\\'m curios to see what  they did and ate. Don\\'t worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we  don\\'t need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and  that is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where  did the household concept \\'immortal\\' come from? Wheat is a weed, it  is programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then  die)    Warning about writing to the past: I had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel  future, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from.  There were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an  Oscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us,  and then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the  others into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by  \"advising\" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into  reproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that  the little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to  provide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it  in his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his  control. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying  that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve  souls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was  finite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in  our reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it  seemed odd, but we couldn\\'t remember how else it should be. Then  some of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no  more, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped  through his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that  he had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body,  existing only on the wind.     MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls  whose will\\'s are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat  others as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a  lonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for  playmates. (its not eternal, there\\'s more than one way back)    Accepting rides to the past: Once here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a  Prince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go  ahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry.  I Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes  your work, but thinks you\\'re getting wise, he can direct you to cross  paths with your old self, and you\\'ll vanish as you rewrite your own  course of history, none the wiser.    As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped  back in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still  make changes while he\\'s here, its just that that is work, and with  every \\'adjustment\\', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which  loosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less.  But he can\\'t see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had  to apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand  to retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers.     How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country,  our money, and they\\'re spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this:  Washington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to  congress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks  are making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big  corporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the  banks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but  mostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14  hours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time  to buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If  we are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if  the point is just to keep the people busy making widgets?     In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, \"its chaos!\" They  said, \"no, its order.\" He defined chaos as that which is he was not  able to control.    Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy  would hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no  language. (telepathic; and \\'vanishing\\' the closest knowledge of death) (think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and  pointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably  naive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should  be able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about.  They can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers  might have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a  different frequency than us as they aren\\'t eating seeds.    Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a  huge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat  only fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and  need a lot less sleep.    UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The  troops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill  each other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)    Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot  tall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they  suck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that  they aren\\'t dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life.     Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women  and children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut  from the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think  that there may be some very interesting results to this, such as  mother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples  of this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.    That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He  tells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which  the people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He\\'ll  play a poker face up until he thinks he\\'s cornered, and then he\\'ll  whine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you\\'re willing to  live on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was  right, and he didn\\'t over play his hand, and he won\\'t need to go  back and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over  your destiny, just don\\'t live along a path that leads to a reality  in which you don\\'t want to be a part of. ',\n",

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE     archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly     included in this FAQ has been removed; please refer to his posting or     the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming     missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.      Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news     frequently.       WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?      The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks     (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).      The \"Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,\" ASC G&C 2102,   \"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is  commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower  clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)  orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a  negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other  advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort  maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of  the horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining  downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target  in second stage.\"      This really is a good answer, but it\\'s couched in NASA jargon. I\\'ll try     to interpret.      1) We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.      2) Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack  between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the  \"relative wind\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line  between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly  negative angle (\"a negative q-alpha\"). This causes a little bit of  \"downward\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z  direction) and this force \"alleviates structural loading.\"  We have to be careful about those wings -- they\\'re about the  most \"delicate\" part of the vehicle.      3) The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more  mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or  to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be  the case if we didn\\'t roll (\"performance gain\").      4) The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated  flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort  maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\"decreased abort maneuver  complexity\").      5) The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio  antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio  antennae on the Orbiter (\"improved S-band look angles\").      6) The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a  helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.      7) The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is  more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east  (usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity  in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:  velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.  The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its  velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.      This all begs the question, \"Why isn\\'t the launch pad oriented to give     this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to     achieve that attitude?\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers     from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one     for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main     Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime     launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is     fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \"top\"     [Orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The     access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented     basically the same way they were for the Saturn V\\'s.  (A side note: the     Saturn V\\'s also had a roll program.  Don\\'t ask me why -- I\\'m a Shuttle     guy.)      I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics. He added that the \"roll     maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.     The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons     stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping     the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw     component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total     maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math     concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element     array.       HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT      NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite     dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72     degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed     over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from     California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.     shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite     for these viewers.      If you can\\'t get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.     It\\'s worth asking if yours doesn\\'t.      The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is     frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press     conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle     missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying     much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions     are not being covered.

They said that from Earth's surface the sky looks like a 60K blackbody. \",\n",
       " '(sci.space readers can skip the first paragraph)    Yesterday, in response to Henry Spencer\\'s question about the  temperature of a blackbody in interstellar space, I said \"Dust grains acts as blackbodies, and they\\'re at 40-150 K.\"  Well, I was dead wrong.  Our local interstellar dust expert, Bruce Draine, has informed me that dust grains _aren\\'t_ good radiators in the far IR, which is why they are so warm; actually, the ambient radiation field from distant stars can bring a true blackbody to only 3 or 4 Kelvin. Sorry, Henry, and anyone else I misled.  Obviously, time for me to take another ISM class :-(    In other news, Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute gave a talk on the Pluto-Charon binary system yesterday.  He gave a brief overview of the currently-accepted system parameters (volume ratio of about 8:1, mass ratio about 15:1 or so, plus lots more...) and then gave his thoughts on the formation of Pluto-Charon.  His idea is  that there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer solar system, with masses distributed as a power law of some kind; over time, the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies.  Most got scattered out of the solar system by close encounters with Jupiter and Saturn, but many accreted into the gas giants, especially Uranus and Neptune.  A large planetesimal was captured by Neptune - we call it Triton [captured how?  Perhaps by a collision with a smaller, already-existing Neptunian moon, perhaps by a very close passage through Neptune\\'s atmosphere - mondo aerobraking!].    He notes that the two recently discovered \"Kuiper Belt\" objects, 1992 QB1 and 1993 FW, plus Chiron and Pholus, are all about the same  mass, and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from the larger bodies of Triton and Pluto/Charon.  Pluto/Charon, he thinks, formed when an impacting body hit proto-Pluto, knocking some material into a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon; similar to ideas about the formation of Earth\\'s moon.  There is good evidence from spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different (Pluto has methane frost, Charon doesn\\'t), which can be used as evidence for the impact theory.    He believes that there may be around 1000 Pluto-to-Chiron-sized objects remaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune\\'s  orbit, beyond 35 AU or so.  1992 QB1 and 1993 FW are the first members of this population to be found, in his model.  Note that such bodies will be very dark, since if their surfaces are covered with methane  frost, it will have photolyzed into very dark, long-chain hydrocarbons by now.  The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5, I think) is that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate, and when the atmosphere freezes out again, thirty years later, it forms bright, new frost.  So any bodies much farther away than 30 AU are going to be very hard to see.    I hope I haven\\'t made any errors in the transcription; if you see a howling mistake, it\\'s undoubtedly mine, not his.    By the way, he\\'s one of the top guns behind the Pluto Fast Flyby mission (I think), and said that the current plans are to use a Titan 4 to send the probe on \"just about a rectilinear trajectory\" to Pluto (we were speaking loosely at the time...).  He\\'d like to use a Proton, which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs MUCH less.  His figures: $500 Million for 2 Titan 4 launches (there will be two separate probes, launched separately), or $120 Million for 2 Proton launches.  He told a story about how the Soviets originally offered to sell Proton launches for $30 Million each, but were forced to increase their prices in the US in order to be allowed in the marketplace.

But they have been systematically            IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years!                  The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he            calls the \"Reciprocal System\", is built on two fundamental            postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of            space and time:                      (1) \"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE            component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE            UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\"                      (2) \"The physical universe conforms to the relations of            ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are            ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\"                      From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE            Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of            translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-           rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward            SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light            (which Larson called \"UNIT VELOCITY\" and \"THE NATURAL            DATUM\").                        At each step in the development, Larson was able to            MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the            REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles            [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star            clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white            dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET            DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY            BURSTS).                            And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom,            Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-           atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility            and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of            matter.                  All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy            complex mathematics, in his books.                   BOOKS of Dewey B.

This is the            organization that was started to promote Larson\\'s Theory.             They have other related publications, including the quarterly            journal \"RECIPROCITY\".                         Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s Background                     Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer            (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he            died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in            Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He            developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE            chemical properties based only on the elements used.                      Larson\\'s lack of a fancy \"PH.D.\" degree might be one            reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is            NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider            to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same            time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX            physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer,            well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC            ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC..                       Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally            test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.             He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER            researchers\\' experimental and observational data.  And in            many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER.                      A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX            physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking            for a \"unified field theory\" that works, but have been            IGNORING one for over 30 years now!                      \"Modern physics\" does NOT explain the physical universe            so well.  Some parts of some of Larson\\'s books are FULL of            quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who            agree.  And remember that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\",            \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED            to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.                           Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior,            was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson\\'s Theory, and was (or            still is) President of Larson\\'s organization, \"THE            INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\", and Editor of            their quarterly Journal \"RECIPROCITY\".  He moved to            Minneapolis after retiring.                   \"Super Collider\" BOONDOGGLE!

Most physicists don\\'t realize it, but, according to the            comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist            Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY            particles (\"mesons\", \"hyperons\", ALLEGED \"quarks\", etc.)            which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab,            Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are            CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly            disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible            with their environment.                      A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a            few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not            seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE            CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW!                      Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3            BILLION cost?!!  Don\\'t we have much more important uses for            this WASTED money?!

How much POISONING of the ground and ground water            with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of            the \"Supercollider\"?!

LARSONIAN Anti-Matter                           In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of            opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more            to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the            photons of which they are made, in relation to the            vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light,            which Larson calls \"Unit Velocity\" and the \"Natural Datum\".                       In Larson\\'s Theory, a positron is actually a particle of            MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet,            the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their            respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each            other.                        In Larson\\'s Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical            universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension            of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our            MATERIAL half.                      LARSONIAN Relativity                           The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury            has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the            rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this            advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational            perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter,            etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to            help \"prove\" Einstein\\'s \"General Theory of Relativity\".                      But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results            CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \"General Relativity\" can, by            INSTEAD using \"SPECIAL Relativity\".  In one or more of his            books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH            ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.                      Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \"General Relativity\" as another            MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \"Special            Relativity\", including the parts about \"mass increases\" near            the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on            doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than            1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT,            although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).                       In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead            of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured            from our material half of the physical universe.  The one            dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low            relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are            NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and            the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR.            [Larson often used the term \"COORDINATE TIME\" when writing            about this.]                            In regard to \"mass increases\", it has been PROVEN in            atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near            the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is            ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists            are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson\\'s Theory,            mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is            actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS            BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.             The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward            SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of            the so-called \"Big Bang\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL            FANTASY).                                                                 THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION                 I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \"THE UNIVERSE            OF MOTION\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific            Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456            pages, indexed, hardcover.                      It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL            UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that            author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago.                      It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical            mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and            multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of            the \"3-degree\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-           ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white            dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc..                      It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL            looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with            OPEN MINDS!                      The following is an example of his Theory\\'s success:            In his first book in 1959, \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL            UNIVERSE\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING            GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding            them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson\\'s            comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he            had an immediate related explanation for them also.                    GAMMA-RAY BURSTS                 Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were            originally thought to originate from \"neutron stars\" in the            disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in            Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions            uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT            correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of            directional coincidence).                      Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of            his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", published in 1984, the            gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the            ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls            the \"Cosmic Sector\".  Because of the relationship between the            anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and            the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can            pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at            random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do            not correspond with known objects, and come from all            directions uniformly.)                      I wonder how close to us in space a source location            would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most            life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to            stop it!                      Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which            are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were            actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS!                   LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation                           About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the            vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox            astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory            theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.                      But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY            CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of            the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey            B. Larson.                      I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is            detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\"            and in some of his other books.                      First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate            energy by \"fusion\".  A small fraction comes from slow            gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE            ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each            element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the            element is, the lower is this limit.  A star\\'s internal            temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and            absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually            reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and            lighter elements.                      When the internal temperature of the star reaches the            destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I            SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron            present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms            and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some            of his books [better than I can].                      When the star explodes, the lighter material on the            outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less            than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center            portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to            the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The            explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and            it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN            SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.                      Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall            back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown            outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The            material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a            WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward            the \"MAIN SEQUENCE\" from opposite directions on the H-R            Diagram.                      The chances of the two masses falling back into the            exact same location in space, making a single lone star            again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY            system, orbiting each other.                       According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE            DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the            material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown            outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \"degenerate matter\", \"neutron            stars\", \"black holes\", etc..                   LARSONIAN Solar System Formation                 If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the            exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single            white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \"mini\" white dwarf            stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably            still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected            by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS!                        In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all            this information, and other principles of his comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive            his own version of Bode\\'s Law.                         \"Black Hole\" FANTASY!                 I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently            completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \"black            holes\" merging together into a SINGLE \"black hole\", and            concluded that the new \"black hole\" would have MORE MASS than            the sum of the two original \"black holes\".                      Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED            FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \"black            holes\", etc.!                      After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s books about            his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe, especially his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", it is            clear to me that \"black holes\" are NOTHING more than            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is            just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \"black            hole\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want            to \"prove\" their theory.                           By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is            being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and            astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking\\'s severe physical            problem somehow makes him \"wiser\".  It does NOT!                      I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist            Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread            publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson\\'s            Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of            Unified Science).                                             ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION                 I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection            with UFO\\'s and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to            find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed.                      I found a possible clue about why they might work on            pages 112-113 of the book \"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\", by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of            Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe.  I quote one paragraph:                      \"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development            of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally            different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.             The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It            was brought out in Volume I [Larson\\'s book \"NOTHING BUT            MOTION\"] that there are physical processes in operation which            produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that,            although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in            many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities            for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are            limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of            free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the            universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged            state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension            space, because they are inherently rotating units of space,            and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open            space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently            in the same location with respect to the natural reference            system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the            stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron,            like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by            the progression of the natural reference system.  All            material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons            similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.             Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later,            whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The            electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth            therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\"                            Note that in Larson\\'s Theory, UNcharged electrons are            also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a            particular frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) spinning            around one axis at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate).             (\"Unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are            vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light,            according to Larson\\'s Theory.)  [I might have the \"above\" and            \"below\" labels mixed up.]                      Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-           LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of            light!                      If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION            fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these            electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a            charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to            achieve propulsion. (In Larson\\'s Theory, an electrical charge            is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular            frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) superimposed on the            rotation of the particle.)                        The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to            confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is            generated in clouds.               SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics                 The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has            been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in            his first book \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\".                      It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan,            and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call            \"science\" (or \"physics\", or \"astronomy\", etc.), as well as            the \"scientific\" literature and the \"education\" systems, to            TOTALLY IGNORE Larson\\'s Theory has they have.                      Larson\\'s Theory has excellent explanations for many            things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such            as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars.                      Larson\\'s Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY            discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals,            in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles            of Larson\\'s Theory should be included in all related courses            at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and            elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a            worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed.

       " 'People who criticize \"big Government\" and its projects rarely seem to have a consistent view of the role of Government in science and technology.  Basically, the U.S. Government has gotten into the role of supporting research which private industry finds too expensive or too long-term.    (Historically, this role for the U.S. Gov\\'t was forced upon it because of socialism in other countries.  In order for U.S.  industries to compete with government-subsidized foreign competitors, the U.S. Gov\\'t has taken on the role of subisizing big-ticket or long-lead R&D.)  As a Republican, I abhor the necessity for our Government to involve itself in technology this way.  I believe that market forces should drive technology, and the world would be a better place for it.  But the whole world would have to implement this concept simultaneously, or some countries would have subsidized R&D, while others would not.  So the U.S. must subsidize because everybody else does.  (This sounds a lot like the farm subsidies arguments behind our GATT negotiations, doesn\\'t it?)  But this role of Government subsidies is antithetical to cost-effectiveness.  The general idea is to spend money on new technology, and thereby maintain and promote our technological culture, despite the forces in the business world (like the dreaded quarterly earnings report) which erode the ability of U.S. industry to invest in new technology.  And since our goal is to spend money, it makes little sense to try to save money.  Of course, we could always spend our money more wisely, but EVERYBODY disagrees about that the wisdom should be.    It\\'s interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost control available in industry today were derived from Government projects. GANTT charts, CP/M, and most of the modern scheduling software comes from DoD projects and their contractors.

Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.     Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.     Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a potential to power the globe.     For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.     The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever increasing demand using proven, basic technology.

Fred is basically correct:  no sophisticated tools, just a lot of effort and painstaking care.  But they got this one right *before* Challenger; Feynman cited the software people as exemplary compared to the engine people.  (He also noted that the software people were starting to feel management pressure to cut corners, but hadn't had to give in to it much yet.)  Among other things, the software people worked very hard to get things right for the major pre-flight simulations, and considered a failure during those simulations to be nearly as bad as an in-flight failure. As a result, the number of major-simulation failures could be counted on one hand, and the number of in-flight failures was zero.  As Fred mentioned elsewhere, this applies only to the flight software. Software that runs experiments is typically mostly put together by the experimenters, and gets nowhere near the same level of Tender Loving Care. (None of the experimenters could afford it.)\",\n",

       " '  This definitely had nothing to do with the entry of the government into the support of science; some of it is relevant in technology.  There was little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of state universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII. The US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was mainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not that many research universities, but they all provided their researchers with low teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for travel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and a university wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well as salary.  During WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure scientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they  were not exactly in the areas of the scientists\\' expertise.  This is probably because of the \"research mind\" approach, which is not to try to find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution emerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to discussion about their problems, the job got done.  The military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the future, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was unwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the future supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as  NSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly keep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations, making it more difficult for them to act to support research.  The worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which the government supports research the university will not provide funding, and in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose, as has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of a graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask for one?  The answer I will get is, \"Get the money from NSF.\"  Now the money at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it comes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from getting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects get supported, and how much.    Also, the government decided that the \"wealth\" should be spread.  So instead of having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research institutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into being.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating reseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal has to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals already done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am proposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find  impossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrow I may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright idea which solves yesterday\\'s too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to something I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast,  and except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it is not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring  more than minimal attention of a good researcher.    I believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would have happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government is trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.',\n",

Larson, 1984, North            Pacific Publishers, Portland, Oregon, 456 pages, indexed,            hardcover.                             \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to            most ALL astrophysical mysteries.                            This book is Volume III of a revised and enlarged            edition of \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\", 1959.             Volume I is \"NOTHING BUT MOTION\" (1979), and Volume II is            \"THE BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\" (1988).                            Most books and journal articles on the subject of            astrophysics are bristling with integrals, partial            differentials, and other FANCY MATHEMATICS.  In this book, by            contrast, mathematics is conspicuous by its absence, except            for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text.             Larson emphasizes CONCEPTS and declares that mathematical            agreement with a theory does NOT guarantee its conceptual            validity.                            Dewey B. Larson was a retired engineer with a Bachelor            of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State            University.  He developed the Theory described in his books            while trying to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATE the            properties of chemical compounds based ONLY on the elements            they contain.                            \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" describes the astrophysical            portions of Larson\\'s CONSISTENT, INTEGRATED, COMPREHENSIVE,            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, a kind of            \"grand unified field theory\" that orthodox physicists and            astro-physicists CLAIM to be looking for.  It is built on two            postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of            space and time:                            (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE            component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE            units, and with two RECIPROCAL aspects, SPACE and TIME.                            (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of            ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its primary magnitudes are            ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.                            From these two postulates, Larson was able to build a            COMPLETE theoretical universe, from photons and subatomic            particles to the giant elliptical galaxies, by combining the            concept of INWARD AND OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with            translational, vibrational, rotational, and rotational-           vibrational motions.  At each step in the development, he was            able to match parts of his theoretical universe with            corresponding parts in the real physical universe, including            EVEN THINGS NOT YET DISCOVERED.  For example, in his 1959            book, he first predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES,            several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them.  They            are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of his comprehensive Theory.  And            when quasars were discovered, he had a related explanation            ready for those also.                            As a result of his theory, which he called \"THE            RECIPROCAL SYSTEM\", Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many of the            sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists,            including black holes, neutron stars, degenerate matter,            quantum wave mechanics (as applied to atomic structure),            \"nuclear\" physics, general relativity, relativistic mass            increases, relativistic Doppler shifts, nuclear fusion in            stars, and the big bang, all of which he considered to be            nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES.  He was very            critical of the AD HOC assumptions, uncertainty principles,            solutions in principle, \"no other way\" declarations, etc.,            used to maintain them.                            \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" is divided into 31 chapters.             It begins with a description of how galaxies are built from            the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters,            which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that            accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in            from the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe.  (Galaxy            formation from the MYTHICAL \"big bang\" is a big mystery to            orthodox astronomers.)  He then goes on to describe life            cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and            solar systems result from Type I supernova explosions of            SINGLE stars.                            Several chapters are devoted to quasars which, according            to Larson, are densely-packed clusters of stars that have            been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies            and are actually traveling FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT            (although most of that speed is AWAY FROM US IN TIME).                            Astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against            observations that contradict their theories would find            Larson\\'s explanations quite valuable if considered with an            OPEN MIND.  For example, they used to believe that GAMMA RAY            BURSTS originated from pulsars, which exist primarily in the            plane or central bulge of our galaxy.  But the new gamma ray            telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from            ALL DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY and do NOT correspond with any            visible objects, (except for a few cases of directional            coincidence).  Larson\\'s explanation is that the gamma ray            bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER            HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls the \"cosmic            sector\".  Because the anti-matter universe exists in a            RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe, with the speed            of light as the BOUNDARY between them, and has THREE            dimensions of time and ONLY ONE dimension of space, the            bursts can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly            at random.                            Larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from            books, journal articles, and leading physicists and            astronomers.  In this book, 351 of them are superscripted            with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the            end of the book.  For example, a quote from the book            \"Astronomy: The Cosmic Journey\", by William K. Hartmann,            says, \"Our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if            we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars            form.... Unfortunately we cannot.\"  Larson\\'s book contains            LOGICAL CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS of such mysteries that are            WORTHY OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION by ALL physicists,            astronomers, and astrophysicists.

Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.     Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.     Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a potential to power the globe.     For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.     The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever increasing demand using proven, basic technology.

       " ' Interstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies.  The \"large\" grains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light with fair efficiency.  However, at temperatures below 100 K, 90% of the thermal emission will be beyond 22 microns, where radiating efficiency is poor.  (A small antenna cannot easily radiate at long wavelengths.)  Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate the energy they have absorbed.  Moreover, the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100 microns.  Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longer wavelengths, and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them.  In the extreme limit, grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectable by any conceivable observation.  Worse still, IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a population of \"small\" grains.  These grains have only perhaps 50 atoms, and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to temperatures of several hundred or 1000 K.  Of course they cool quickly and then stay cold for a while, but _when they are radiating_ the characteristic temperature is several hundred K.  Even a small population of these grains can dramatically raise the observed \"average\" temperature.  A model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has three components.  These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal dust (color temperature 5500 K), thermal emission from Zodiacal dust (Tc = 280 K), and thermal emission from Galactic dust (Tc=25 K).  At the ecliptic poles, the emissivities or dilution factors are respectively 1.9E-13, 4E-8, and 2E-5.  The first two are roughly doubled in the ecliptic plane.  To find the thermal equilibrium temperature, we add up the dilution factor times the fourth power of temperature for all components, then take the fourth root.  In the table below, starlight comes from Allen\\'s number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent to 460 zero mag stars with B-V color of 0.75.  No doubt careful work could do much better.  (The person who suggested starlight had a dilution factor of E-4 must have been remembering wrong.  We would be cooked if that were the case.  In any event, the energy density of starlight comes out about the same as that of the microwave background, and I believe that to be correct.)                           Dilution   Temp.

But they have been systematically            IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years!                  The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he            calls the \"Reciprocal System\", is built on two fundamental            postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of            space and time:                      (1) \"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE            component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE            UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\"                      (2) \"The physical universe conforms to the relations of            ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are            ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\"                      From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE            Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of            translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-           rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward            SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light            (which Larson called \"UNIT VELOCITY\" and \"THE NATURAL            DATUM\").                        At each step in the development, Larson was able to            MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the            REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles            [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star            clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white            dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET            DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY            BURSTS).                            And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom,            Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-           atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility            and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of            matter.

They have other related publications, including the quarterly            journal \"RECIPROCITY\".                         Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s Background                     Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer            (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he            died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in            Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He            developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE            chemical properties based only on the elements used.                      Larson\\'s lack of a fancy \"PH.D.\" degree might be one            reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is            NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider            to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same            time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX            physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer,            well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC            ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC..                       Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally            test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.             He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER            researchers\\' experimental and observational data.  And in            many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER.                      A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX            physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking            for a \"unified field theory\" that works, but have been            IGNORING one for over 30 years now!                      \"Modern physics\" does NOT explain the physical universe            so well.  Some parts of some of Larson\\'s books are FULL of            quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who            agree.  And remember that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\",            \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED            to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.                           Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior,            was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson\\'s Theory, and was (or            still is) President of Larson\\'s organization, \"THE            INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\", and Editor of            their quarterly Journal \"RECIPROCITY\".

Most physicists don\\'t realize it, but, according to the            comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist            Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY            particles (\"mesons\", \"hyperons\", ALLEGED \"quarks\", etc.)            which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab,            Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are            CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly            disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible            with their environment.                      A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a            few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not            seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE            CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW!                      Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3            BILLION cost?!!  Don\\'t we have much more important uses for            this WASTED money?!

How much POISONING of the ground and ground water            with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of            the \"Supercollider\"?!                                 Naming the \"Super Collider\" after Ronald Reagon, as            proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be            named after a leading particle PHYSICIST.                     LARSONIAN Anti-Matter                           In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of            opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more            to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the            photons of which they are made, in relation to the            vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light,            which Larson calls \"Unit Velocity\" and the \"Natural Datum\".                       In Larson\\'s Theory, a positron is actually a particle of            MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet,            the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their            respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each            other.                        In Larson\\'s Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical            universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension            of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our            MATERIAL half.                      LARSONIAN Relativity                           The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury            has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the            rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this            advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational            perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter,            etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to            help \"prove\" Einstein\\'s \"General Theory of Relativity\".                      But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results            CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \"General Relativity\" can, by            INSTEAD using \"SPECIAL Relativity\".  In one or more of his            books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH            ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.                      Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \"General Relativity\" as another            MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \"Special            Relativity\", including the parts about \"mass increases\" near            the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on            doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than            1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT,            although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).                       In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead            of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured            from our material half of the physical universe.  The one            dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low            relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are            NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and            the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR.            [Larson often used the term \"COORDINATE TIME\" when writing            about this.]                            In regard to \"mass increases\", it has been PROVEN in            atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near            the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is            ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists            are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson\\'s Theory,            mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is            actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS            BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.             The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward            SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of            the so-called \"Big Bang\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL            FANTASY).                                                                 THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION                 I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \"THE UNIVERSE            OF MOTION\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific            Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456            pages, indexed, hardcover.                      It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL            UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that            author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago.                      It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical            mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and            multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of            the \"3-degree\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-           ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white            dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc..                      It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL            looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with            OPEN MINDS!                      The following is an example of his Theory\\'s success:            In his first book in 1959, \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL            UNIVERSE\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING            GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding            them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson\\'s            comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he            had an immediate related explanation for them also.                    GAMMA-RAY BURSTS                 Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were            originally thought to originate from \"neutron stars\" in the            disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in            Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions            uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT            correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of            directional coincidence).                      Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of            his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", published in 1984, the            gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the            ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls            the \"Cosmic Sector\".  Because of the relationship between the            anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and            the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can            pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at            random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do            not correspond with known objects, and come from all            directions uniformly.)                      I wonder how close to us in space a source location            would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most            life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to            stop it!                      Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which            are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were            actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS!                   LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation                           About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the            vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox            astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory            theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.                      But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY            CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of            the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey            B. Larson.                      I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is            detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\"            and in some of his other books.                      First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate            energy by \"fusion\".  A small fraction comes from slow            gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE            ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each            element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the            element is, the lower is this limit.  A star\\'s internal            temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and            absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually            reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and            lighter elements.                      When the internal temperature of the star reaches the            destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I            SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron            present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms            and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some            of his books [better than I can].                      When the star explodes, the lighter material on the            outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less            than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center            portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to            the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The            explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and            it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN            SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.                      Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall            back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown            outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The            material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a            WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward            the \"MAIN SEQUENCE\" from opposite directions on the H-R            Diagram.                      The chances of the two masses falling back into the            exact same location in space, making a single lone star            again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY            system, orbiting each other.                       According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE            DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the            material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown            outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \"degenerate matter\", \"neutron            stars\", \"black holes\", etc..                   LARSONIAN Solar System Formation                 If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the            exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single            white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \"mini\" white dwarf            stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably            still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected            by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS!                        In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all            this information, and other principles of his comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive            his own version of Bode\\'s Law.                         \"Black Hole\" FANTASY!                 I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently            completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \"black            holes\" merging together into a SINGLE \"black hole\", and            concluded that the new \"black hole\" would have MORE MASS than            the sum of the two original \"black holes\".                      Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED            FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \"black            holes\", etc.!                      After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s books about            his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe, especially his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", it is            clear to me that \"black holes\" are NOTHING more than            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is            just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \"black            hole\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want            to \"prove\" their theory.                           By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is            being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and            astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking\\'s severe physical            problem somehow makes him \"wiser\".  It does NOT!                      I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist            Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread            publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson\\'s            Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of            Unified Science).                                             ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION                 I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection            with UFO\\'s and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to            find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed.                      I found a possible clue about why they might work on            pages 112-113 of the book \"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\", by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of            Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe.  I quote one paragraph:                      \"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development            of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally            different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.             The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It            was brought out in Volume I [Larson\\'s book \"NOTHING BUT            MOTION\"] that there are physical processes in operation which            produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that,            although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in            many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities            for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are            limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of            free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the            universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged            state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension            space, because they are inherently rotating units of space,            and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open            space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently            in the same location with respect to the natural reference            system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the            stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron,            like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by            the progression of the natural reference system.  All            material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons            similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.             Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later,            whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The            electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth            therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\"                            Note that in Larson\\'s Theory, UNcharged electrons are            also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a            particular frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) spinning            around one axis at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate).             (\"Unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are            vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light,            according to Larson\\'s Theory.)  [I might have the \"above\" and            \"below\" labels mixed up.]                      Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-           LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of            light!                      If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION            fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these            electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a            charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to            achieve propulsion. (In Larson\\'s Theory, an electrical charge            is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular            frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) superimposed on the            rotation of the particle.)                        The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to            confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is            generated in clouds.               SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics                 The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has            been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in            his first book \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\".                      It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan,            and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call            \"science\" (or \"physics\", or \"astronomy\", etc.), as well as            the \"scientific\" literature and the \"education\" systems, to            TOTALLY IGNORE Larson\\'s Theory has they have.                      Larson\\'s Theory has excellent explanations for many            things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such            as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars.                      Larson\\'s Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY            discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals,            in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles            of Larson\\'s Theory should be included in all related courses            at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and            elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a            worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed.

       " '  Well, the best thing to do is to read the book \"Parallel Universes\" by Dr. Fred Wolf.   In essence, Dr. Wolf says that one interpretation of the sub-atomic particle/wave duality is that what we perceive as a wave is actually an infinate number of parallel universes overlaid, and in each of these universes there is a particle in a different location. When we do something to make a particle \"appear,\" we are actually causing all the parallel universes to collapse into one. Apparently this is one line of thought on the nature of QM, that is going through some of the scientific community.  Dr. Wolf (and many others) claim that somehow the collapse is caused by the mental effort of observing the particle. This implys that mind is more than merely a biological phenomenon. He then extrapolates that if mind is an integral part of the universe, then perhaps consciousness is the element that gives order and form to the universe(s) it/themself(s).  It all gets rather interesting, but what I find facinating is that this would explain the phenomenon of \"magick\" as practiced in my religion. Dr. Wolf speculates that the ordering functionality of mind could be caused by the selection of a future from an infinite number of possible futures; he says that this might be done by some sort of communication between ones current, and possible future selves.  I have long speculated that if magick is not merely a form of self delusion then perhaps it could be caused by some sort of a selection of one of many possible futures.  I realize that this gets pretty bizarre, but it never hurts to keep  an open mind and at least file it all away as another possibile  explaination of the world in which we find ourselves. After all, the more we learn about the universe in which we live, the more we learn that it is truly a very strange place. ',\n",

This scaling is          cited for lunar craters and may hold true for          other bodies.    (1/3.4)     S = (p / p )     : correction factor for target density p  ,      p   a   t           t          p  = 1.8 g/cm^3 for alluvium at the Jangle U           a          crater site, p = 2.6 g/cm^3 for average          rock on the continental shields.      C       : crater collapse factor, 1 for craters <= 3 km          in diameter, 1.3 for larger craters (on Earth).

       " 'Archive-name: space/astronaut Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:02 $  HOW TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT      First the short form, authored by Henry Spencer, then an official NASA     announcement.      Q. How do I become an astronaut?      A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it\\'s probably     impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying     passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have     so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you\\'re better off hoping to     win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet     experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you     want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle \"mission     specialist\".      If you aren\\'t a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,     the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly     exceeds the supply.  NASA\\'s problem is not finding qualified people,     but thinning the lineup down to manageable length. It is not enough     to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,     many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.      Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands     dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer     programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-     seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in     another seems to be a frequent winner.      Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight. (DO NOT get a     radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows     what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term     effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other     significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,     you should be okay; if you can\\'t, your chances are poor.      Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in     appearance and actions; you\\'ve got a tough selling job ahead, trying     to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you     are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you     will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is     a significant part of the job, and NASA\\'s image is very prim and     proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.     Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,     and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.     Keep your nose clean.      Get a pilot\\'s license and make flying your number one hobby;     experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.      Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,     43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were     a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).     If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job     at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant \"you     do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first\".      Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance     to demonstrate motivation.      Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn\\'t make it the first time.         NASA     National Aeronautics and Space Administration     Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center     Houston, Texas      Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates     ==================================================================      Astronaut Candidate Program     ---------------------------      The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for     Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates     to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a     continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.      Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be     considered.      All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in     Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation     program.      Space Shuttle Program Description     ---------------------------------      The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated     that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming     routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in     the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then     returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and     flight crew.      The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment     and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation     of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials     processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will     eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space     station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher     orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space     Shuttle\\'s capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include     government agencies and private industries.      The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,     and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are     assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA     astronauts.      Pilot Astronaut      Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.     During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,     crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the     commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the     pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing     the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other     payload operations.      Mission Specialist Astronaut      Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,     have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations     in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and     experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to     have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed     knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and     objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the     experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission     specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling     using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific     experimental operations.

Quality of     academic preparation is important.      2. At least 1000 hours pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. Flight     test experience highly desirable.      3. Ability to pass a NASA Class I space physical which is similar to a     military or civilian Class I flight physical and includes the following     specific standards:    Distant visual acuity:        20/50 or better uncorrected        correctable to 20/20, each eye.    Blood pressure:        140/90 measured in sitting position.      4. Height between 64 and 76 inches.      Citizenship Requirements      Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of     the United States.      Note on Academic Requirements      Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic     education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --     specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum     in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor\\'s     degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,     biological science, physical science, or mathematics.        The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the     sciences, are not considered qualifying:       - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology,  Medical Technology, etc.)       - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological  Psychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).       - Degrees in Nursing.       - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)       - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.      Application Procedures     ----------------------      Civilian      The application package may be obtained by writing to:   NASA Johnson Space Center  Astronaut Selection Office  ATTN: AHX  Houston, TX 77058      Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA     decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be     given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is     made. Applications received after that date will be retained and     considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually     of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate     continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants     who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from     consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the     preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be     requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as     supervisors and references may be contacted.      Active Duty Military      Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their     respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application     procedures will be disseminated by each service.      Selection     ---------      Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required     for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.     Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered     will be notified of the outcome of the process.      Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the     selection of additional candidates during a one year period following     their establishment.      General Program Requirements      Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be     assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,     Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and     evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or     scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to     ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut     training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills     required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot     astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during     their candidate period.      Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does     not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut     will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and     evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the     training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become     permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for     a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not     selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA     depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that     time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a     specified tour of duty.      NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified     minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.     Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.      Pay and Benefits     ----------------      Civilians      Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal     Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,     and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements     and experience.      Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and     participation in group health and life insurance plans.      Military      Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center     but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and     other similar military matters.

       " 'I feel compelled to complain: the statement that recent observations rule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma-ray bursts is utterly false, even though it is popular enough to make it to BATSE press releases. The idea behind the statement is as follows:       \"if you smack two neutron       stars together, or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole,       a lot of energy is released, enough for a gamma-ray burst at a       cosmological distance. But, so the reasoning continues, this energy        is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes       thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum.       The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must       be wrong.\" As so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person who was trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. It may be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray burst, but the \\'fireball\\' of energy and matter that is created may spew out a relativistic flow. When this slams into the surrounding  medium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may carry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. All this is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees, Peter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers. It is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one around (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternative proposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the  so-called \\'failed supernovae\\' scenario by Stan Woosley, in which a very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black hole. If the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter will be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal force, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the black hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis, which again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of such events may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers, but the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate of bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two scenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less in the failed supernova scenario.  On another note: I do believe that the distance scale must  ultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method such as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths, or finding a definitive signature of some known class of objects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. Theorists have historically not been too successfull in finding the distance of any object by proving that there is only one possible way in which the object can work, and therefore it *must* be so-and-so.',\n",
       " '    That would not explain why widely separated detectors, such as on Ulysses and PVO and Ginga et al., would see a burst at the same time(*).  In fact, be- fore BATSE, having this widely separated \"Interplanetary Network\" was the only sure way to locate a random burst.  With only one detector, one cannot locate a burst (except to say \"It\\'s somewhere in the field of view.\").  With two detectors, one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detector to narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky.  With three detectors, one gets intersecting annuli, giving two possible locations.  If one of these locations is impossible (because, say, the Earth blocked that part of the  sky), voila, you have an error box.  BATSE, by having 8 detectors of its own, can do its own location determination, but only to within about 3 degrees (would someone at GSFC, like David, like to comment on the current state of location determination?).  Having inde- pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty.  You did touch on something that you didn\\'t mean to, though.  Some believe (in a reference that I have somewhere) that absorption-like features seen in a fraction of GRBs can actually be caused by the detector.  It would be a mean, nasty God, though, that would have a NaI crystal act like a 10^12 Gauss neutron star...but this is getting too far afield.',\n",

       " \"    Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are seen coming equally from all directions. However, given the number of bright ones, there are too few faint ones to be consistent with being equally dense for as far as we can see--it is as if they are all contained within a finite sphere (or a sphere with fuzzy edges) with us at the center.  (These measurements are statistical, and you can always hide a sufficiently small number of a different type of GRB with a different origin in the data.  I am assuming that there is only one population of GRBs).  The data indicates that we are less than 10% of the radius of the center of the distribution.  The only things the Earth is at the exact center of are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of comets way beyond Pluto) and the Universe.  Cosmological theories, placing GRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies to be released over a timescale of milliseconds.  Oort cloud models tend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics.  If GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy) you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane of the Galaxy (for a 'disk' population), or towards the Galactic center (for a spherical 'halo' population).  We don't see this, so if they are Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years in radius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the Andromeda Galaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)  For comparison, the Earth is 25,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy.   The aren't concentrated in the known spacelanes, and we don't see many coming from Zeta Reticuli and Tau Ceti.

I don't have a calculator, but I DO have the problem set that we did not too long ago, so I'll use that, and hope it's what you wanted.   This is a highly simplified problem, with a very simple burst.  Bursts are usually more complex than this example I will use here.         Our burst has a peak flux of 5.43E-6 ergs cm^-2 sec^-1 and a duration of 8.95 seconds.  During the frst second of the burst, and the last 4 seconds, its flux is half of the peak flux.  It's flux is the peak flux the rest of the time.  Assume that the background flux is 10E-7 erg cm^-2 sec^-1.         Then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst, for several different spheres: R=.25pc(Oort Cloud Radius), R=22.5pc(at the edge of the galaxy), R=183.5pc or the edge of the galactic corona, and lastly at a R=8800Mpc.           We integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence, then used the old standby formula:                         Luminosity=4(pi)(r^2)Fpeak         For a radius of .25 pc, we found an L around 10^32 erg/sec.  Pretty energetic for close by.  for the coronal model, we found around 10^43 erg/sec. And lastly, for the cosmological model an L=10^53. That's what you'd call moderately energetic, I'd say.

Big difference.    That\\'s ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution    to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well    known - in particular comet aphelia (which are not well known)    are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution...  Merging neutron stars is at least a mechanism with about the right energy, except it doesn\\'t explain why there is no apparent correlation with galaxies or galaxy structure, there is no mechanism for getting all the energy out in gamma rays (with any significant amount of baryons around there will be a lot of pair production, which makes a plasma, which thermalizes the energy), it has trouble generating enough energy to explain the most powerful bursts (10^52-53 ergs), it happens too fast compared to the burst duration, and it is hard to make tight-binaries of neutron stars.  Another cosmological mechinism is the catalytic conversion of a neutron star to a strange star or the merger of two strange stars, but that uses pretty far-out physics.  My point is that we don\\'t have a good mechanism at any distance, so GRB\\'s are likely to be happening by an unknown mechanism, so we can\\'t rule out the Oort cloud.

The energy matches very well for both of these mechanisms.

The fact that we don\\'t know the distribution of comets in the Oort cloud isn\\'t a reason to rule them out; it makes it harder to rule them out.

Now, in the good old days before GRO data, it was thought the gamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy, it was expected that GRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population (within a few hundred light years) or that they were in the galactic halo. (Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed) (also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was probably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...)  As the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo population should show anisotropy (a local disk population is ruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you have to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanism of getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should start to see for example the Andromeda\\'s bursters.  The data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution (but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with the right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (hence isotropy) and the edge is \"the edge of the Universe\" ;-) If at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect) and a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron star colliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then getting the spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.   If we know anything about physics at that level, the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic strings, wrong spectrum for one thing.

       " '        Well, lets see....I took a class on this last fall, and I have no notes so I\\'ll try to wing it...           Here\\'s how I understand it. Remember from stellar evolution that  black holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars, M(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking appoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time, they don\\'t live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any of these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB\\'s) will be in the plane of the galaxy.           Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the various satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either Pion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our catalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic distribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of homogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are sampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE. Not cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I suppose you are saying, \"Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the disk.\"  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an interplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out to beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here\\'s an  analogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from the origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile away sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his arbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different, and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe find a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.           I should throw in why halo, and corona models don\\'t work, also.  As I said before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short timescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of behavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound to the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources. When you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk, but you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see not only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources  in the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none of these characteristics.  ',\n",

       " '  But I believe that there is a fundamental difference here.  The other x three instruments are focusing instruments, that, more or less, form an image, so positional errors are limited by craft attitude and the  resolving power of the optics.  BATSE is an altogether different beast, effectively just 8 coincidence counters, one on each corner of  the craft.  Positional information is triangulated from the  differential signal arrival times at each of the detectors. Positional error would be predominantly determined by timing errors and errors in craft attitude. Since none of the 8 BASTE detectors have any independant angular resolution whatsoever, they can not be used to determine parallax.  Indeed, parallax would just add a very small  component to the positional error.    Demonstrating that these puppies are beyond the oort cloud would  require resolution on the order of arcseconds, since the oort  cloud is postulated to extend to about 0.5 parsec (all together  now: \"Parallax ARc SECond\", a parsec is the distance of an object  that demonstrates one arc second of parallax with a 2 AU base line). If the 3 degree accuracy reported above is true, we\\'re going to  have to add a BASTE to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline.

Out of how many?  What are the different levels?  I've never    heard of this rating system.  Anyone care to clue me in?  This is a rating system used by ARPA and other organisations to measure the maturity of a `software process' i.e. the entire process by which software gets designed, written, tested, delivered, supported etc.  See `Managing the Software Process', by Watts S. Humphrey, Addison Wesley 1989. An excellent software engineering text. The 5 levels of software process maturity are:  1. Initial 2. Repeatable 3. Defined 4. Managed 5. Optimizing  The levels are approximately characterized as follows:  1. no statistically software process control. Have no statistical    basis for estimating how large software will be, how long it will    take to produce, how expensive it will be, or how reliable it will    be.  Most software production is at this level.  2. stable process with statistical controls, rigorous project    management; having done something once, can do it again. Projects    are planned in detail, and there is software configuration    management and quality assurance.  3. The process is defined and understood, implementation is    consistent. This includes things like software inspection, a    rigorous software testing framework, more configuration management,    and typically a `software engineering process group' within the    project.  4. Statistical information on the software is systematically gathered    and analysed, and the process is controlled on the basis of this    information. Software quality is measured and has goals.  5. Defects are prevented, the process is automated, software contracts    are effective and certified.\",\n",

In case of the Earth z is about 23.5 degrees, I think. I do not recall the exact value.  In case of Uranus, z is almost 90 degrees.  u = latitude of the location where the length of the day is measured. Paris is at about 45 degrees.  North pole is at 90.  a = angular position of the planet around the sun.  As a goes from 0 to 360 degrees, the planet makes a full circle around the sun. The spring equinox occurs at a=0.  L = daylight fraction = (duration of daylight)/(duration of a full day). On the equator (u=0) L is always 1/2.  Near the north pole (u=90 degrees) L is sometimes one and sometimes zero, depending on the time of the year.  Computation: Define the auxiliary angles p and q by: sin p = sin a sin z cos q = h ( tan u tan p ),       (0 < q < 180 degrees)  Conclusion: L = q / 180   (if q is measured in degrees) L = q / pi    (if q is measured in radians)  Wait!

It is the home of several Russian space enterprises, including NPO Energia, Krunichev, Fakel, and Tsniimach.  The main Russian manned spacecraft control facility is also located here.    Kaliningrad is easily reachable by auto from Moscow, and tours can be arranged.  Call ahead though, there are still armed military guards at many of these facilities -- who don't speak English, aren't well paid, and are rather bored.

Participants who complete the program can earn two semester hours of graduate credit from Aurora College. Please note that while the class is intended for teachers, it is not restricted to teachers.  The class, which is being cosponsored by the United States Space Foundation, will teach how to use space exploration as a teaching tool to get students excited about learning and interested in science.  Classroom topics to be covered by the class include:      > Living in Space      > The Space Shuttle      > The Space Station      > NASA Spinoffs that Benefit Society      > Principles of Astrodynamics/Aeronautics      > The Solar System  There will also be simulated Zero-G training in an underwater space station simulation, model rocket launches, observing sessions at the Harper College Observatory, and field trips to the Adler Planetarium and the Museum of Science and Industry.  Featured speakers include Jerry Brown of the Colorado based United States Space Foundation and Debbie Brown of the NASA Lewis Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Additional instructors will be provided by the Planetary Studies Foundation.  The social highlight of the class will be a dinner banquet featuring Space Shuttle Payload Specialist Byron Lichtenberg, currently President of Payload Systems, Inc. Lichtenberg was a member of the crew of STS-9 which flew in November 1983. The banquet is scheduled for Thursday, June 17.  The registration fee includes transportation for field trips, materials, continental breakfasts, lunches, and the special dinner banquet. Guest tickets for the dinner banquet are also available.

       " 'I have attached a copy of an announcement I picked up during my trip to Moscow last week.  I have several friends at the Moscow Aviation Institute who have asked me to post this announcement.  (I have done some editing, but the contents is unchanged from the original announcement.)   For those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute, it is the leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training of aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframe design, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems. Virtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev, Su, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.  I had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at MAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of an F-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye opening experience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a year or so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity to see some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines for future space craft use.  If you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I would be glad to try and answer them.  The institute, and most of it\\'s faculty have e-mail addresses.  However, it takes about a day or so for the receiver to get the message.  They are still a bit antiquated - but they are rapidly changing!

Bussard, Journal of  Propulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990       Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion      systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the      thrust-power \"gain\" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values      of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are      always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, \"high-thrust\"      interplanetary flight is not possible, because system      acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local      gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100      times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer      \"high-thrust\" flight capability. One performance example shows a      53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with      19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows      the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in      Earth/moon space.   \"The QED Engine System: Direct Electric Fusion-Powered Systems for  Aerospace Flight Propulsion\" by Robert W. Bussard, EMC2-1190-03,  available from Energy/Matter Conversion Corp., 9100 A. Center  Street, Manassas, VA 22110.       [This is an introduction to the application of Bussard\\'s version      of the Farnsworth/Hirsch electrostatic confinement fusion      technology to propulsion. 1500<Isp<5000 sec. Farnsworth/Hirsch      demonstrated a 10**10 neutron flux with their device back in      1969 but it was dropped when panic ensued over the surprising      stability of the Soviet Tokamak. Hirsch, responsible for the      panic, has recently recanted and is back working on QED. -- Jim      Bowery]   \"PLASMAKtm Star Power for Energy Intensive Space Applications\", by  Paul M. Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion  Energy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.       Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron      flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times      larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma      pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds      could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities      and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and      other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm      innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure      efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically      compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power      conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens      of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the      multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages      indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I      strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob      Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently      declared Koloc\\'s PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one      of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather      than Tokamak. Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, the      PLASMAKtm looks like it finally models ball-lightning with solid      MHD physics. -- Jim Bowery]      ION DRIVES:   Retrieve files pub/SPACE/SPACELINK/6.5.2.* from the Ames SPACE  archive; these deal with many aspects of ion drives and describe the  SERT I and II missions, which flight-tested cesium ion thrusters in  the 1960s and 70s.

So by the time you get done, paying for materials, workers, and other expenses you can owe more than what you made.

If I forgot or botched your favorite acronym, please let me know!  Also, if there\\'s an acronym *not* on this list that confuses you, drop me a line, and if I can figure it out, I\\'ll add it to the list.  Note that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen* acronyms, and is most emphatically *not* encyclopedic.  If I incorporated every acronym I ever saw, I\\'d soon run out of disk space!  :-)  The list will be posted at regular intervals, every 30 days.  All comments regarding it are welcome; I\\'m reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu.  Note that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you\\'re on your own for figuring out what they *mean*!  Note also that the total number of acronyms in use far exceeds what I can list; special-purpose acronyms that are essentially always explained as they\\'re introduced are omitted. Further, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of Edition 3 of the list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless they\\'re simply different ways of referring to the same thing.  Thanks to everybody who\\'s sent suggestions since the first version of the list, and especially to Garrett A. Wollman (wollman@griffin.uvm.edu), who is maintaining an independent list, somewhat more verbose in character than mine, and to Daniel Fischer (dfi@specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de), who is maintaining a truly HUGE list (535 at last count) of acronyms and terms, mostly in German (which I read, fortunately).  Special thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA, who sent me a copy of NASA Reference Publication 1059 Revised: _Space Transportation System and Associated Payloads: Glossary, Acronyms, and Abbreviations_, a truly mammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of TLAs.  Special Bonus!  At the end of this posting, you will find a perl program written by none other than Larry Wall, whose purpose is to scramble the acronym list in an entertaining fashion.

       " 'Archive-name: space/intro Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:10 $      FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON SCI.SPACE/SCI.ASTRO      INTRODUCTION      This series of linked messages is periodically posted to the Usenet groups sci.space and sci.astro in an attempt to provide good answers to frequently asked questions and other reference material which is worth preserving. If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked questions that you would like included in this posting, send email to leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).      If you don\\'t want to see the FAQ, add \\'Frequently Asked Questions\\' to your KILL file for this group (if you\\'re not reading this with a newsreader that can kill articles by subject, you\\'re out of luck).      The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down by rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in the Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.      Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The point of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old answers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing than rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided because they give more complete information than any short generalization.      Questions fall into three basic types:      1) Where do I find some information about space?      Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask     for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There     are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended     discussion.      2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?      Hope you aren\\'t surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been     thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for     evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.      3) Miscellanous queries.      These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of     FAQ postings.       SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE      Read news.announce.newusers if you\\'re on Usenet.     Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]     Edit \"Subject:\" lines, especially if you\\'re taking a tangent.     Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth  100 posts).     Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST  not SPACE.     Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all  references.)     Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you\\'re  responding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!     Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail  or article), state your institution, etc. Don\\'t assume the  \\'reply\\' function of mailers will work.     Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don\\'t post what everyone  will get on TV anyway.     Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:  keep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals  (use carriage returns).       INDEX TO LINKED POSTINGS      I\\'ve attempted to break the postings up into related areas. There isn\\'t     a keyword index yet; the following lists the major subject areas in each     posting.

In the US that means NASA.  If you have basic information requests: (e.g., general PR info, research grants, data, limited tours, and ESPECIALLY SUMMER EMPLOYMENT (typically resumes should be ready by Jan.  1), etc.), consider contacting the nearest NASA Center to answer your questions.  EMail typically will not get you any where, computers are used by investigators, not PR people. The typical volume of mail per Center is a multiple of 10,000 letters a day. Seek the Public Information Office at one of the below, this is their job:  NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is the civilian space agency of of the United States Federal Government. It reports directly to the White House and is not a Cabinet post such as the military Department of Defense.  Its 20K+ employees are civil servants and hence US citizens.  Another 100K+ contractors also work for NASA.

JPL is run under contract for NASA by the nearby California  Institute of Technology, unlike the NASA centers above. This  distinction is subtle but critical. JPL has different requirements  for unsolicited research proposals and summer hires. For instance in  the latter, an SF 171 is useless. Employees are Caltech employees,  contractors, and for the most part have similar responsibilities.  They offer an alternative to funding after other NASA Centers.

INTRODUCTION      A wide variety of images, data, catalogs, information releases, and     other material dealing with space and astronomy may be found on the net.     A few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access, while the     remainder support some form of file transfer. Many sites are listed as     providing \\'anonymous FTP\\'. This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on     the Internet. Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP     directly, but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via     email. Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com     or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you instructions     on how to make requests.      The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames     SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center.      Don\\'t even ask for images to be posted to the net. The data volume is     huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it.   VIEWING IMAGES      The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly     large, and I won\\'t attempt to cover common formats (GIF, etc.) here. To     read PDS and VICAR (and many other) formats on Unix systems running X,     use XV 2.11, available by anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu     (18.24.0.12) in contrib/xv-2.11.tar.Z and the other standard X11 FTP     sites.      The FAQ for the Usenet group alt.binaries.pictures discusses image     formats and how to get image viewing software. A copy of this document     is available by anonymous FTP from the Usenet FAQ archives at     pit-manager.mit.edu (18.72.1.58), in directory     pub/usenet/alt.binaries.pictures.   ONLINE ARCHIVES      NASA AMES      Extensive archives are maintained at NASA Ames and are available via     anonymous FTP or an email server. These archives include many images and     a wide variety of documents including this FAQ list, NASA press     releases, shuttle launch advisories, and mission status reports. Please     note that these are NOT maintained on an official basis.      FTP users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) and look in     pub/SPACE. pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the     archive (the index is about 200K by itself).      To access the archives by email, send a letter to     archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the     subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:   send SPACE Index  send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91.      The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. All are in     caps. Only text files are handled by the email server at present; use     one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this     section for images or programs.      The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus CD-ROM image     disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories. The     disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. Thousands of images are     available in these collections.      The GIF directory contains images in GIF format. The VICAR directory     contains Magellan images in VICAR format (these are also available in     the GIF directory). A PC program capable of displaying these files is     found in the IMDISP directory (see the item \"VIEWING IMAGES\" below).      The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to     contact their public affairs officers; this may be useful when pursuing     specific information. It\\'s in MISC/media.guide.      Any problems with the archive server should be reported to Peter Yee     (yee@ames.arc.nasa.gov).       NASA ASTROPHYSICS DATA SYSTEM      The ADS is a distributed data retrieval system which is easy to use and     provides uniform access to ground-based and space-based astronomy data     from NASA data centers across the country. It currently has over 140     data catalogs of radio, infrared, optical, UV, and X-ray data which can     be queried by position or any other parameter in the catalog. The ADS     also provides tools to manipulate and plot tabular results. In addition,     ADS has a Beta version of an Abstracts Service which allows users to     query over 125,000 abstracts of astronomy papers since 1975 by authors,     keywords, title words, or abstract text words.      ADS use requires direct Internet access. For more info and to sign up to     become a user, email ads@cuads.coloradu.edu. The User\\'s Guide and     \"QuickStart\" Guide are available by anonymous FTP to sao-ftp.harvard.edu     in directory pub/ads/ADS_User_Guide (PostScript files).

NASA SPACELINK      SpaceLink is an online service located at Marshall Space Flight Center     in Huntsville, Alabama. The system is specifically designed for     teachers. The data base is arranged to provide easy access to current     and historical information on NASA aeronautics, space research, and     technology transfer information. Also included are suggested classroom     activities that incorporate information on NASA projects to teach a     number of scientific principles. Unlike bulletin board systems, NASA     Spacelink does not provide for interaction between callers. However it     does allow teachers and other callers to leave questions and comments     for NASA which may be answered by regular mail. Messages are answered     electronically, even to acknowledge requests which will be fulfilled by     mail. Messages are generally handled the next working day except during     missions when turnaround times increase. The mail system is closed-loop     between the user and NASA.      SpaceLink also offers downloadable shareware and public domain programs     useful for science educators as well as space graphics and GIF images     from NASA\\'s planetary probes and the Hubble Telescope.

The catalogue contains 1292 entries which represent     all known comets through November 1989 and is 96 pages long.     Non-subscribers to the Circulars may purchase the catalogue for $15.00     while the cost to subscribers is $7.50. The basic catalogue in ASCII     along with a program to extract specific orbits and calculate     ephemerides is available on MS-DOS 5.25-inch 2S2D diskette at a cost of     $75.00 (the program requires an 8087 math coprocessor). The catalogue     alone is also available by e-mail for $37.50 or on magnetic tape for     $300.00.      Except for the printed version of the catalogue, the various magnetic     media or e-mail forms of the catalogue do not specifically meantion     non-subscribers. It is possible that these forms of the catalogue may     not be available to non-subscribers or that their prices may be more     expensive than those given.

       " 'Archive-name: space/net Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:15 $  NETWORK RESOURCES  OVERVIEW      You may be reading this document on any one of an amazing variety of     computers, so much of the material below may not apply to you. In     general, however, systems connected to \\'the net\\' fall in one of three     categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent     between these networks, and other resources available on one of these     networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to     special \\'servers\\'.      The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of     several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.      One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central     distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In     addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for     Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more     specialized mailing lists described below.      A second mechanism is Usenet \\'netnews\\'. This is somewhat like a bulletin     board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews     separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a     \\'group name\\'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are     called \\'sci.space.news\\', \\'sci.space\\', \\'sci.space.shuttle\\', \\'sci.astro\\',     and \\'talk.politics.space\\'. Contributors \\'post\\' submissions (called     \\'articles\\' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends     it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby     machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so     that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet     sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was     posted.      Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and     BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not     accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more     flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make     it the preferred option.  MAILING LISTS      SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the     International Space University (in only its second change of management     in over a decade). Email space-request@isu.isunet.edu (message body     should be in the format \\'subscribe space John Public\\') to join. Note     that the moderated SPACE Magazine list is defunct at present for lack of     a moderator. Old copies of SPACE Digest since its inception in 1981 are     available by anonymous FTP. Retrieve  julius.cs.qub.ac.uk:pub/SpaceDigestArchive/README     for further details.      Elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of Space Shuttle     Keplerian Elements before and during Shuttle flights. NASA two line     elements are sent out on the list from Dr. Kelso, JSC, and other sources     as they are released. Email to elements-request@telesoft.com to join.      GPS Digest is a moderated list for discussion of the Global Positioning     System and other satellite navigation positioning systems. Email to     gps-request@esseye.si.com to join.      Space-investors is a list for information relevant to investing in     space-related companies. Email Vincent Cate (vac@cs.cmu.edu) to join.      Space-tech is a list for more technical discussion of space topics;     discussion has included esoteric propulsion technologies, asteroid     capture, starflight, orbital debris removal, etc. Email to     space-tech-request@cs.cmu.edu to join. Archives of old digests and     selected excerpts are available by anonymous FTP from     gs80.sp.cs.cmu.edu (128.2.205.90) in /usr/anon/public/space-tech,     or by email to space-tech-request if you don\\'t have FTP access.      SEDS-L is a BITNET list for members of Students for the Exploration and     Development of Space and other interested parties. Email     LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET with a message saying \"SUBSCRIBE SEDS-L your     name\". Email saying \"INDEX SEDS-L\" to list the archive contents.      SEDSNEWS is a BITNET list for news items, press releases, shuttle status     reports, and the like. This duplicates material which is also found in     Space Digest, sci.space, sci.space.shuttle, and sci.astro. Email     LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET saying \"SUBSCRIBE SEDSNEWS your name\" to join.     Email saying \"INDEX SEDSNEWS\" to list the archive contents.      Ron Baalke (baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) runs a mailing list which     carries the contents of the sci.space.news Usenet group. Email him     to join the list.      As a general note, please mail to the *request* address to get off a     mailing list. SPACE Digest, for example, relays many inappropriate     \\'please remove me from this list\\' messages which are sent to the list     address rather than the request address.  PERIODICALLY UPDATED INFORMATION      In addition to this FAQ list, a broad variety of topical information is     posted to the net (unless otherwise noted, in the new group     sci.space.news created for this purpose). Please remember that the     individuals posting this information are performing a service for all     net readers, and don\\'t take up their time with frivolous requests.      ACRONYMS  Garrett Wollman (wollman@UVM.EDU) posts an acronym list around the  first of each month.      ASTRO-FTP LIST  Veikko Makela (veikko.makela@helsinki.fi) posts a monthly list of  anonymous FTP servers containing astronomy and space related  material to sci.space and sci.astro.

       " 'The following statement was released on February 27,1992 by the Science & Environmental Policy Project  As independent scientists researching atmosphere and climate problems, we are  concerned by the agenda for UNCED, the United Nations Conference on  Environment and Development, being developed by environmental and  activists  groups and certain political leaders. This so called \"Earth Summit\" is  scheduled to convene in  Brazil in June 1992 and aims to impose a system of  global envionmental regulations, including onerous taxes on energy fuels, on  the population of the United States and other industrialized nations. Such policy initiatives derive from highly uncetain scientific theories. They  are based on the unsupported assumption that catastrophic global warming  follows from the burning of fossill fuels and requires immediate action. We  do not agree.  A survey of U.S. Atmospheric scientists, conducted in the summer of 1991,  confirms that there is  no consesensus about the cause of the slight warming  observed during the past century. A recently published research paper even  suggests sunspot variability (which is directly proportional to solar  activity),  rather  than a rise in greenhouse gases is responsible for the  global temperature increases and decreases recoded since about 1880. Futhermore, the majority of scientific participants in the survey agreed that  the theoretical climate climate models used to predict a future warming  cannot be relied upon and are not validated by the existing climate record.  Yet all predictions are based on such theoretical models. Finally, agriculturalits generally agree that any increase in carbon dioxide  levels from fossil fuels burning has beneficial effects on most crops and on  world food supply. We are disturbed that activists, anxious to stop energy and economic growth,  are pushing ahead with drastic policies without taking notice of recent  changes in the underlying science. We fear that the rush to impose global  regulations will have catastrophic impacts on the world economy, on jobs,  standards of living, and health care, with the most severe consequences  falling on developing countries and the  poor.

       " 'Government-Mandated Energy Conservation is Unnecessary and Wastful, Study Finds    Washington, DC -- The energy tax and subsidized energy-efficiency   measures supported by President Clinton and Energy Secretary Hazel   O\\'Leary are based on faulty assumptions, a new study from the Cato   Institute points out.      According to Jerry Taylor, Cato\\'s director of natural resource studies,   we are not running out of sources of energy. The world now has almost 10   times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of   1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as   dramatically.      When standards of living, population densities, and industrial   structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy   efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group   of Seven nations.      Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil   price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the   cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,   even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the   overall U.S. economy.      Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per   $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies.      Utilities\\' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side   management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource   inputs, an competitive inequities. Furthermore, DSM programs do not   reduce demand.      Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes   unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that   subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance,   gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood   of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state   at the expense of the individual.      \"Energy Conservation and Efficiency: The Case Against Coercion\" is no.   189 in the Policy Analysis series published by the Cato Institute, an   independent public policy research organization in Washington, DC.    Available from:   Cato Institute   224 Second Street SE   Washington, DC  20003    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                             The Cato Institute      Founded in 1977, the Cato Institute is a public policy research   foundation dedicated to broadening the parameters of policy debate   to allow consideration of more options that are consistent with the   traditional American principles of limited government, individual   liberty, and peace.  To that end, the Institute strives to achieve   greater involvement of the intelligent, concerned lay public in    questions of policy and the proper role of government.     The Institute is named for Cato\\'s Letters, libertarian pamphlets   that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early 18th   century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation   of the American Revolution.     Despite the achievement of the nation\\'s Founders, today virtually   no aspect of life is free from government encroachment.  A pervasive   intolerance for individual rights is shown by government\\'s arbitrary   intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for   civil liberties.     To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive   publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy   issues.  Books, monographs, and shorter studies are commissioned   to examine the federal budget, Social Security, regulation, military   spending, international trade, and myriad other issues.  Major policy   conferences are held throughout the year, from which papers are   published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal.     In order to maintain its independence, the Cato Institute accepts   no government funding.  Contributions are received from foundations,   corporations, and individuals, and other revenue is generated from   the sale of publications.  The Institute is a nonprofit, tax-exempt,   educational foundation under Section 501(c)3 of the Internal Revenue   Code.']"
